Court is now in session, the Honorable Judge Patricia Reyes presiding.Judge: Please be seated. Today, we will hear closing arguments in People v. Johnson. Mr. Brown, you may proceed.Mr. Brown (Prosecutor): Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, over the past few days, you’ve seen clear evidence that Alex Johnson was the last person in the gallery on the night the painting disappeared. Security footage shows him carrying a large item out of the building, and no one else has been conﬁrmed to have accessed that area until the theft was discovered.Mr. Johnson claims he only took his toolkit. Yet, he had every opportunity and the means to steal the painting. The defense has tried to distract you with irrelevant details and speculative theories about others who might have been involved, but they have provided no evidence, no proof. This case is about what happened, not about what might have happened. Based on the facts presented, I ask you to return a verdict of guilty. Thank you.Judge: Thank you, Mr. Brown. Ms. Lee, your closing statement?Ms. Lee (Defense Attorney): Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the prosecution’s case rests entirely on assumptions. The only “evidence” they have is a security video showing my client carrying a toolkit—an item consistent with his work as an art installer. There is no direct evidence that he took the painting.In fact, you heard from Mr. Tate, a reliable witness, who saw another individual, the former gallery manager, on the premises that night—a person with both access and, we believe, motive to take that painting. The gallery owner chose not to pursue this lead, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t real.My client is innocent, and he deserves the beneﬁt of the doubt. I urge you to weigh the facts carefully. Thank you.Judge: Thank you, Ms. Lee. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you have heard the evidence and the arguments from both sides.
