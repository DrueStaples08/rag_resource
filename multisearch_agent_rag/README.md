## MultiSearch Agent RAG Systems
Task: Taking in multiple inputs (e.g. arxiv research papers, wikipedia, and web content as input), apply a LLM, prompt, and agent to generate responses. 

1. Tools -> Toolkits
    - Tools: Interfaces for LLMs, agents, or chains to interact with users in a more efficient data-responsive manner
2. Agents:
    - Background systems that use LLMs to make decisions on actions to take (e.g. llama2, gpt, gemma2, etc, )
3. Prompts:
    - Given set of instructions to assist the agent on making decisions (e.g. ChatPromptTemplate).
