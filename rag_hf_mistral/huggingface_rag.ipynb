O VERVIEW OF RAG\\nA typical application of RAG is illustrated in Figure 2.\\nHere, a user poses a question to ChatGPT about a recent,\\nwidely discussed news. Given ChatGPT’s reliance on pre-\\ntraining data, it initially lacks the capacity to provide up-\\ndates on recent developments. RAG bridges this information\\ngap by sourcing and incorporating knowledge from external\\ndatabases. In this case, it gathers relevant news articles related\\nto the user’s query. These articles, combined with the original\\nquestion, form a comprehensive prompt that empowers LLMs\\nto generate a well-informed answer.\\nThe RAG research paradigm is continuously evolving, and\\nwe categorize it into three stages: Naive RAG, Advanced\\nRAG, and Modular RAG, as showed in Figure 3.

It mainly consists of 3 steps. 1) Indexing. Documents are split into chunks,\\nencoded into vectors, and stored in a vector database. 2) Retrieval. Retrieve the Top k chunks most relevant to the question based on semantic similarity. 3)\\nGeneration. Input the original question and the retrieved chunks together into LLM to generate the final answer.\\nwidespread adoption of ChatGPT. The Naive RAG follows\\na traditional process that includes indexing, retrieval, and\\ngeneration, which is also characterized as a “Retrieve-Read”\\nframework [7].\\nIndexing starts with the cleaning and extraction of raw data\\nin diverse formats like PDF, HTML, Word, and Markdown,\\nwhich is then converted into a uniform plain text format. To\\naccommodate the context limitations of language models, text\\nis segmented into smaller, digestible chunks. Chunks are then\\nencoded into vector representations using an embedding model\\nand stored in vector database. This step is crucial for enabling\\nefficient similarity searches in the subsequent retrieval phase.\\nRetrieval . Upon receipt of a user query, the RAG system\\nemploys the same encoding model utilized during the indexing\\nphase to transform the query into a vector representation.\\nIt then computes the similarity scores between the query\\nvector and the vector of chunks within the indexed corpus.\\nThe system prioritizes and retrieves the top K chunks that\\ndemonstrate the greatest similarity to the query. These chunks\\nare subsequently used as the expanded context in prompt.\\nGeneration . The posed query and selected documents are\\nsynthesized into a coherent prompt to which a large language\\nmodel is tasked with formulating a response. The model’s\\napproach to answering may vary depending on task-specific\\ncriteria, allowing it to either draw upon its inherent parametric\\nknowledge or restrict its responses to the information con-\\ntained within the provided documents. In cases of ongoing\\ndialogues, any existing conversational history can be integrated\\ninto the prompt, enabling the model to engage in multi-turn\\ndialogue interactions effectively.\\nHowever, Naive RAG encounters notable drawbacks:Retrieval Challenges . The retrieval phase often struggles\\nwith precision and recall, leading to the selection of misaligned\\nor irrelevant chunks, and the missing of crucial information.\\nGeneration Difficulties . In generating responses, the model\\nmay face the issue of hallucination, where it produces con-\\ntent not supported by the retrieved context. This phase can\\nalso suffer from irrelevance, toxicity, or bias in the outputs,\\ndetracting from the quality and reliability of the responses.\\nAugmentation Hurdles . Integrating retrieved information\\nwith the different task can be challenging, sometimes resulting\\nin disjointed or incoherent outputs. The process may also\\nencounter redundancy when similar information is retrieved\\nfrom multiple sources, leading to repetitive responses. Deter-\\nmining the significance and relevance of various passages and\\nensuring stylistic and tonal consistency add further complexity.\\nFacing complex issues, a single retrieval based on the original\\nquery may not suffice to acquire adequate context information.\\nMoreover, there’s a concern that generation models might\\noverly rely on augmented information, leading to outputs that\\nsimply echo retrieved content without adding insightful or\\nsynthesized information.\\nB. Advanced RAG\\nAdvanced RAG introduces specific improvements to over-\\ncome the limitations of Naive RAG. Focusing on enhancing re-\\ntrieval quality, it employs pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strate-\\ngies. To tackle the indexing issues, Advanced RAG refines\\nits indexing techniques through the use of a sliding window\\napproach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of\\nmetadata. Additionally, it incorporates several optimization\\nmethods to streamline the retrieval process [8].'),\n",

(Left) Naive RAG mainly consists of three parts: indexing, retrieval and generation. (Middle)\\nAdvanced RAG proposes multiple optimization strategies around pre-retrieval and post-retrieval, with a process similar to the Naive RAG, still following a\\nchain-like structure. (Right) Modular RAG inherits and develops from the previous paradigm, showcasing greater flexibility overall. This is evident in the\\nintroduction of multiple specific functional modules and the replacement of existing modules. The overall process is not limited to sequential retrieval and\\ngeneration; it includes methods such as iterative and adaptive retrieval.\\nPre-retrieval process . In this stage, the primary focus is\\non optimizing the indexing structure and the original query.\\nThe goal of optimizing indexing is to enhance the quality of\\nthe content being indexed. This involves strategies: enhancing\\ndata granularity, optimizing index structures, adding metadata,\\nalignment optimization, and mixed retrieval. While the goal\\nof query optimization is to make the user’s original question\\nclearer and more suitable for the retrieval task. Common\\nmethods include query rewriting query transformation, query\\nexpansion and other techniques [7], [9]–[11].\\nPost-Retrieval Process . Once relevant context is retrieved,\\nit’s crucial to integrate it effectively with the query. The main\\nmethods in post-retrieval process include rerank chunks and\\ncontext compressing. Re-ranking the retrieved information to\\nrelocate the most relevant content to the edges of the prompt is\\na key strategy. This concept has been implemented in frame-\\nworks such as LlamaIndex2, LangChain3, and HayStack [12].\\nFeeding all relevant documents directly into LLMs can lead\\nto information overload, diluting the focus on key details with\\nirrelevant content.To mitigate this, post-retrieval efforts con-\\ncentrate on selecting the essential information, emphasizing\\ncritical sections, and shortening the context to be processed.\\n2https://www.llamaindex.ai\\n3https://www.langchain.com/C. Modular RAG\\nThe modular RAG architecture advances beyond the for-\\nmer two RAG paradigms, offering enhanced adaptability and\\nversatility. It incorporates diverse strategies for improving its\\ncomponents, such as adding a search module for similarity\\nsearches and refining the retriever through fine-tuning. Inno-\\nvations like restructured RAG modules [13] and rearranged\\nRAG pipelines [14] have been introduced to tackle specific\\nchallenges. The shift towards a modular RAG approach is\\nbecoming prevalent, supporting both sequential processing and\\nintegrated end-to-end training across its components. Despite\\nits distinctiveness, Modular RAG builds upon the foundational\\nprinciples of Advanced and Naive RAG, illustrating a progres-\\nsion and refinement within the RAG family.\\n1) New Modules: The Modular RAG framework introduces\\nadditional specialized components to enhance retrieval and\\nprocessing capabilities. The Search module adapts to spe-\\ncific scenarios, enabling direct searches across various data\\nsources like search engines, databases, and knowledge graphs,\\nusing LLM-generated code and query languages [15]. RAG-\\nFusion addresses traditional search limitations by employing\\na multi-query strategy that expands user queries into diverse\\nperspectives, utilizing parallel vector searches and intelligent\\nre-ranking to uncover both explicit and transformative knowl-\\nedge [16]. The Memory module leverages the LLM’s memory\\nto guide retrieval, creating an unbounded memory pool that'),\n",

Routing in the RAG system\\nnavigates through diverse data sources, selecting the optimal\\npathway for a query, whether it involves summarization,\\nspecific database searches, or merging different information\\nstreams [19]. The Predict module aims to reduce redundancy\\nand noise by generating context directly through the LLM,\\nensuring relevance and accuracy [13]. Lastly, the Task Adapter\\nmodule tailors RAG to various downstream tasks, automating\\nprompt retrieval for zero-shot inputs and creating task-specific\\nretrievers through few-shot query generation [20], [21] .This\\ncomprehensive approach not only streamlines the retrieval pro-\\ncess but also significantly improves the quality and relevance\\nof the information retrieved, catering to a wide array of tasks\\nand queries with enhanced precision and flexibility.\\n2) New Patterns: Modular RAG offers remarkable adapt-\\nability by allowing module substitution or reconfiguration\\nto address specific challenges. This goes beyond the fixed\\nstructures of Naive and Advanced RAG, characterized by a\\nsimple “Retrieve” and “Read” mechanism. Moreover, Modular\\nRAG expands this flexibility by integrating new modules or\\nadjusting interaction flow among existing ones, enhancing its\\napplicability across different tasks.\\nInnovations such as the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read [7]model\\nleverage the LLM’s capabilities to refine retrieval queries\\nthrough a rewriting module and a LM-feedback mechanism\\nto update rewriting model., improving task performance.\\nSimilarly, approaches like Generate-Read [13] replace tradi-\\ntional retrieval with LLM-generated content, while Recite-\\nRead [22] emphasizes retrieval from model weights, enhanc-\\ning the model’s ability to handle knowledge-intensive tasks.\\nHybrid retrieval strategies integrate keyword, semantic, and\\nvector searches to cater to diverse queries. Additionally, em-\\nploying sub-queries and hypothetical document embeddings\\n(HyDE) [11] seeks to improve retrieval relevance by focusing\\non embedding similarities between generated answers and real\\ndocuments.\\nAdjustments in module arrangement and interaction, such\\nas the Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) [23] framework\\nand the iterative Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read flow of ITER-\\nRETGEN [14], showcase the dynamic use of module out-\\nputs to bolster another module’s functionality, illustrating a\\nsophisticated understanding of enhancing module synergy.\\nThe flexible orchestration of Modular RAG Flow showcases\\nthe benefits of adaptive retrieval through techniques such as\\nFLARE [24] and Self-RAG [25]. This approach transcends\\nthe fixed RAG retrieval process by evaluating the necessity\\nof retrieval based on different scenarios. Another benefit of\\na flexible architecture is that the RAG system can more\\neasily integrate with other technologies (such as fine-tuning\\nor reinforcement learning) [26]. For example, this can involve\\nfine-tuning the retriever for better retrieval results, fine-tuning\\nthe generator for more personalized outputs, or engaging in\\ncollaborative fine-tuning [27].\\nD. RAG vs Fine-tuning\\nThe augmentation of LLMs has attracted considerable atten-\\ntion due to their growing prevalence. Among the optimizationmethods for LLMs, RAG is often compared with Fine-tuning\\n(FT) and prompt engineering. Each method has distinct charac-\\nteristics as illustrated in Figure 4. We used a quadrant chart to\\nillustrate the differences among three methods in two dimen-\\nsions: external knowledge requirements and model adaption\\nrequirements. Prompt engineering leverages a model’s inherent\\ncapabilities with minimum necessity for external knowledge\\nand model adaption. RAG can be likened to providing a model\\nwith a tailored textbook for information retrieval, ideal for pre-\\ncise information retrieval tasks. In contrast, FT is comparable\\nto a student internalizing knowledge over time, suitable for\\nscenarios requiring replication of specific structures, styles, or\\nformats.\\nRAG excels in dynamic environments by offering real-\\ntime knowledge updates and effective utilization of external\\nknowledge sources with high interpretability. However, it\\ncomes with higher latency and ethical considerations regarding\\ndata retrieval. On the other hand, FT is more static, requiring\\nretraining for updates but enabling deep customization of the\\nmodel’s behavior and style. It demands significant compu-\\ntational resources for dataset preparation and training, and\\nwhile it can reduce hallucinations, it may face challenges with\\nunfamiliar data.\\nIn multiple evaluations of their performance on various\\nknowledge-intensive tasks across different topics, [28] re-\\nvealed that while unsupervised fine-tuning shows some im-\\nprovement, RAG consistently outperforms it, for both exist-\\ning knowledge encountered during training and entirely new\\nknowledge. Additionally, it was found that LLMs struggle\\nto learn new factual information through unsupervised fine-\\ntuning. The choice between RAG and FT depends on the\\nspecific needs for data dynamics, customization, and com-\\nputational capabilities in the application context. RAG and\\nFT are not mutually exclusive and can complement each\\nother, enhancing a model’s capabilities at different levels.\\nIn some instances, their combined use may lead to optimal\\nperformance. The optimization process involving RAG and FT\\nmay require multiple iterations to achieve satisfactory results.\\nIII. R ETRIEVAL\\nIn the context of RAG, it is crucial to efficiently retrieve\\nrelevant documents from the data source. There are several\\nkey issues involved, such as the retrieval source, retrieval\\ngranularity, pre-processing of the retrieval, and selection of\\nthe corresponding embedding model.\\nA. Retrieval Source\\nRAG relies on external knowledge to enhance LLMs, while\\nthe type of retrieval source and the granularity of retrieval\\nunits both affect the final generation results.\\n1) Data Structure: Initially, text is s the mainstream source\\nof retrieval. Subsequently, the retrieval source expanded to in-\\nclude semi-structured data (PDF) and structured data (Knowl-\\nedge Graph, KG) for enhancement. In addition to retrieving\\nfrom original external sources, there is also a growing trend in\\nrecent researches towards utilizing content generated by LLMs\\nthemselves for retrieval and enhancement purposes.'),\n",

RAG compared with other model optimization methods in the aspects of “External Knowledge Required” and “Model Adaption Required”. Prompt\\nEngineering requires low modifications to the model and external knowledge, focusing on harnessing the capabilities of LLMs themselves. Fine-tuning, on\\nthe other hand, involves further training the model. In the early stages of RAG (Naive RAG), there is a low demand for model modifications. As research\\nprogresses, Modular RAG has become more integrated with fine-tuning techniques.\\nUnstructured Data , such as text, is the most widely used\\nretrieval source, which are mainly gathered from corpus. For\\nopen-domain question-answering (ODQA) tasks, the primary\\nretrieval sources are Wikipedia Dump with the current major\\nversions including HotpotQA4(1st October , 2017), DPR5(20\\nDecember, 2018). In addition to encyclopedic data, common\\nunstructured data includes cross-lingual text [19] and domain-\\nspecific data (such as medical [67]and legal domains [29]).\\nSemi-structured data . typically refers to data that contains a\\ncombination of text and table information, such as PDF. Han-\\ndling semi-structured data poses challenges for conventional\\nRAG systems due to two main reasons. Firstly, text splitting\\nprocesses may inadvertently separate tables, leading to data\\ncorruption during retrieval. Secondly, incorporating tables into\\nthe data can complicate semantic similarity searches. When\\ndealing with semi-structured data, one approach involves lever-\\naging the code capabilities of LLMs to execute Text-2-SQL\\nqueries on tables within databases, such as TableGPT [85].\\nAlternatively, tables can be transformed into text format for\\nfurther analysis using text-based methods [75]. However, both\\nof these methods are not optimal solutions, indicating substan-\\ntial research opportunities in this area.\\nStructured data , such as knowledge graphs (KGs) [86] ,\\nwhich are typically verified and can provide more precise in-\\nformation. KnowledGPT [15] generates KB search queries and\\nstores knowledge in a personalized base, enhancing the RAG\\nmodel’s knowledge richness. In response to the limitations of\\nLLMs in understanding and answering questions about textual\\ngraphs, G-Retriever [84] integrates Graph Neural Networks\\n4https://hotpotqa.github.io/wiki-readme.html\\n5https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR(GNNs), LLMs and RAG, enhancing graph comprehension\\nand question-answering capabilities through soft prompting\\nof the LLM, and employs the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree\\n(PCST) optimization problem for targeted graph retrieval. On\\nthe contrary, it requires additional effort to build, validate,\\nand maintain structured databases. On the contrary, it requires\\nadditional effort to build, validate, and maintain structured\\ndatabases.\\nLLMs-Generated Content. Addressing the limitations of\\nexternal auxiliary information in RAG, some research has\\nfocused on exploiting LLMs’ internal knowledge. SKR [58]\\nclassifies questions as known or unknown, applying retrieval\\nenhancement selectively. GenRead [13] replaces the retriever\\nwith an LLM generator, finding that LLM-generated contexts\\noften contain more accurate answers due to better alignment\\nwith the pre-training objectives of causal language modeling.\\nSelfmem [17] iteratively creates an unbounded memory pool\\nwith a retrieval-enhanced generator, using a memory selec-\\ntor to choose outputs that serve as dual problems to the\\noriginal question, thus self-enhancing the generative model.\\nThese methodologies underscore the breadth of innovative\\ndata source utilization in RAG, striving to improve model\\nperformance and task effectiveness.\\n2) Retrieval Granularity: Another important factor besides\\nthe data format of the retrieval source is the granularity of\\nthe retrieved data. Coarse-grained retrieval units theoretically\\ncan provide more relevant information for the problem, but\\nthey may also contain redundant content, which could distract\\nthe retriever and language models in downstream tasks [50],\\n[87]. On the other hand, fine-grained retrieval unit granularity\\nincreases the burden of retrieval and does not guarantee seman-\\ntic integrity and meeting the required knowledge. Choosing'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf_sources/pdf_data_source1.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='8\\nthe appropriate retrieval granularity during inference can be\\na simple and effective strategy to improve the retrieval and\\ndownstream task performance of dense retrievers.\\nIn text, retrieval granularity ranges from fine to coarse,\\nincluding Token, Phrase, Sentence, Proposition, Chunks, Doc-\\nument. Among them, DenseX [30]proposed the concept of\\nusing propositions as retrieval units. Propositions are defined\\nas atomic expressions in the text, each encapsulating a unique\\nfactual segment and presented in a concise, self-contained nat-\\nural language format. This approach aims to enhance retrieval\\nprecision and relevance. On the Knowledge Graph (KG),\\nretrieval granularity includes Entity, Triplet, and sub-Graph.\\nThe granularity of retrieval can also be adapted to downstream\\ntasks, such as retrieving Item IDs [40]in recommendation tasks\\nand Sentence pairs [38]. Detailed information is illustrated in\\nTable I.\\nB. Indexing Optimization\\nIn the Indexing phase, documents will be processed, seg-\\nmented, and transformed into Embeddings to be stored in a\\nvector database. The quality of index construction determines\\nwhether the correct context can be obtained in the retrieval\\nphase.\\n1) Chunking Strategy: The most common method is to split\\nthe document into chunks on a fixed number of tokens (e.g.,\\n100, 256, 512) [88]. Larger chunks can capture more context,\\nbut they also generate more noise, requiring longer processing\\ntime and higher costs. While smaller chunks may not fully\\nconvey the necessary context, they do have less noise. How-\\never, chunks leads to truncation within sentences, prompting\\nthe optimization of a recursive splits and sliding window meth-\\nods, enabling layered retrieval by merging globally related\\ninformation across multiple retrieval processes [89]. Never-\\ntheless, these approaches still cannot strike a balance between\\nsemantic completeness and context length. Therefore, methods\\nlike Small2Big have been proposed, where sentences (small)\\nare used as the retrieval unit, and the preceding and following\\nsentences are provided as (big) context to LLMs [90].\\n2) Metadata Attachments: Chunks can be enriched with\\nmetadata information such as page number, file name, au-\\nthor,category timestamp. Subsequently, retrieval can be filtered\\nbased on this metadata, limiting the scope of the retrieval.\\nAssigning different weights to document timestamps during\\nretrieval can achieve time-aware RAG, ensuring the freshness\\nof knowledge and avoiding outdated information.\\nIn addition to extracting metadata from the original doc-\\numents, metadata can also be artificially constructed. For\\nexample, adding summaries of paragraph, as well as intro-\\nducing hypothetical questions. This method is also known as\\nReverse HyDE. Specifically, using LLM to generate questions\\nthat can be answered by the document, then calculating the\\nsimilarity between the original question and the hypothetical\\nquestion during retrieval to reduce the semantic gap between\\nthe question and the answer.\\n3) Structural Index: One effective method for enhancing\\ninformation retrieval is to establish a hierarchical structure for\\nthe documents. By constructing In structure, RAG system can\\nexpedite the retrieval and processing of pertinent data.Hierarchical index structure . File are arranged in parent-\\nchild relationships, with chunks linked to them. Data sum-\\nmaries are stored at each node, aiding in the swift traversal\\nof data and assisting the RAG system in determining which\\nchunks to extract. This approach can also mitigate the illusion\\ncaused by block extraction issues.\\nKnowledge Graph index . Utilize KG in constructing the\\nhierarchical structure of documents contributes to maintaining\\nconsistency. It delineates the connections between different\\nconcepts and entities, markedly reducing the potential for\\nillusions. Another advantage is the transformation of the\\ninformation retrieval process into instructions that LLM can\\ncomprehend, thereby enhancing the accuracy of knowledge\\nretrieval and enabling LLM to generate contextually coherent\\nresponses, thus improving the overall efficiency of the RAG\\nsystem. To capture the logical relationship between document\\ncontent and structure, KGP [91] proposed a method of building\\nan index between multiple documents using KG. This KG\\nconsists of nodes (representing paragraphs or structures in the\\ndocuments, such as pages and tables) and edges (indicating\\nsemantic/lexical similarity between paragraphs or relationships\\nwithin the document structure), effectively addressing knowl-\\nedge retrieval and reasoning problems in a multi-document\\nenvironment.\\nC. Query Optimization\\nOne of the primary challenges with Naive RAG is its\\ndirect reliance on the user’s original query as the basis for\\nretrieval. Formulating a precise and clear question is difficult,\\nand imprudent queries result in subpar retrieval effectiveness.\\nSometimes, the question itself is complex, and the language\\nis not well-organized. Another difficulty lies in language\\ncomplexity ambiguity. Language models often struggle when\\ndealing with specialized vocabulary or ambiguous abbrevi-\\nations with multiple meanings. For instance, they may not\\ndiscern whether “LLM” refers to large language model or a\\nMaster of Laws in a legal context.\\n1) Query Expansion: Expanding a single query into mul-\\ntiple queries enriches the content of the query, providing\\nfurther context to address any lack of specific nuances, thereby\\nensuring the optimal relevance of the generated answers.\\nMulti-Query . By employing prompt engineering to expand\\nqueries via LLMs, these queries can then be executed in\\nparallel. The expansion of queries is not random, but rather\\nmeticulously designed.\\nSub-Query . The process of sub-question planning represents\\nthe generation of the necessary sub-questions to contextualize\\nand fully answer the original question when combined. This\\nprocess of adding relevant context is, in principle, similar\\nto query expansion. Specifically, a complex question can be\\ndecomposed into a series of simpler sub-questions using the\\nleast-to-most prompting method [92].\\nChain-of-Verification(CoVe) . The expanded queries undergo\\nvalidation by LLM to achieve the effect of reducing halluci-\\nnations. Validated expanded queries typically exhibit higher\\nreliability [93].'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf_sources/pdf_data_source1.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='9\\n2) Query Transformation: The core concept is to retrieve\\nchunks based on a transformed query instead of the user’s\\noriginal query.\\nQuery Rewrite .The original queries are not always optimal\\nfor LLM retrieval, especially in real-world scenarios. There-\\nfore, we can prompt LLM to rewrite the queries. In addition to\\nusing LLM for query rewriting, specialized smaller language\\nmodels, such as RRR (Rewrite-retrieve-read) [7]. The imple-\\nmentation of the query rewrite method in the Taobao, known\\nas BEQUE [9] has notably enhanced recall effectiveness for\\nlong-tail queries, resulting in a rise in GMV .\\nAnother query transformation method is to use prompt\\nengineering to let LLM generate a query based on the original\\nquery for subsequent retrieval. HyDE [11] construct hypothet-\\nical documents (assumed answers to the original query). It\\nfocuses on embedding similarity from answer to answer rather\\nthan seeking embedding similarity for the problem or query.\\nUsing the Step-back Prompting method [10], the original\\nquery is abstracted to generate a high-level concept question\\n(step-back question). In the RAG system, both the step-back\\nquestion and the original query are used for retrieval, and both\\nthe results are utilized as the basis for language model answer\\ngeneration.\\n3) Query Routing: Based on varying queries, routing to\\ndistinct RAG pipeline,which is suitable for a versatile RAG\\nsystem designed to accommodate diverse scenarios.\\nMetadata Router/ Filter . The first step involves extracting\\nkeywords (entity) from the query, followed by filtering based\\non the keywords and metadata within the chunks to narrow\\ndown the search scope.\\nSemantic Router is another method of routing involves\\nleveraging the semantic information of the query. Specific\\napprach see Semantic Router6. Certainly, a hybrid routing\\napproach can also be employed, combining both semantic and\\nmetadata-based methods for enhanced query routing.\\nD. Embedding\\nIn RAG, retrieval is achieved by calculating the similarity\\n(e.g. cosine similarity) between the embeddings of the ques-\\ntion and document chunks, where the semantic representation\\ncapability of embedding models plays a key role. This mainly\\nincludes a sparse encoder (BM25) and a dense retriever (BERT\\narchitecture Pre-training language models). Recent research\\nhas introduced prominent embedding models such as AngIE,\\nV oyage, BGE,etc [94]–[96], which are benefit from multi-task\\ninstruct tuning. Hugging Face’s MTEB leaderboard7evaluates\\nembedding models across 8 tasks, covering 58 datasests. Ad-\\nditionally, C-MTEB focuses on Chinese capability, covering\\n6 tasks and 35 datasets. There is no one-size-fits-all answer\\nto “which embedding model to use.” However, some specific\\nmodels are better suited for particular use cases.\\n1) Mix/hybrid Retrieval : Sparse and dense embedding\\napproaches capture different relevance features and can ben-\\nefit from each other by leveraging complementary relevance\\ninformation. For instance, sparse retrieval models can be used\\n6https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router\\n7https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboardto provide initial search results for training dense retrieval\\nmodels. Additionally, pre-training language models (PLMs)\\ncan be utilized to learn term weights to enhance sparse\\nretrieval. Specifically, it also demonstrates that sparse retrieval\\nmodels can enhance the zero-shot retrieval capability of dense\\nretrieval models and assist dense retrievers in handling queries\\ncontaining rare entities, thereby improving robustness.\\n2) Fine-tuning Embedding Model: In instances where the\\ncontext significantly deviates from pre-training corpus, partic-\\nularly within highly specialized disciplines such as healthcare,\\nlegal practice, and other sectors replete with proprietary jargon,\\nfine-tuning the embedding model on your own domain dataset\\nbecomes essential to mitigate such discrepancies.\\nIn addition to supplementing domain knowledge, another\\npurpose of fine-tuning is to align the retriever and generator,\\nfor example, using the results of LLM as the supervision signal\\nfor fine-tuning, known as LSR (LM-supervised Retriever).\\nPROMPTAGATOR [21] utilizes the LLM as a few-shot query\\ngenerator to create task-specific retrievers, addressing chal-\\nlenges in supervised fine-tuning, particularly in data-scarce\\ndomains. Another approach, LLM-Embedder [97], exploits\\nLLMs to generate reward signals across multiple downstream\\ntasks. The retriever is fine-tuned with two types of supervised\\nsignals: hard labels for the dataset and soft rewards from\\nthe LLMs. This dual-signal approach fosters a more effective\\nfine-tuning process, tailoring the embedding model to diverse\\ndownstream applications. REPLUG [72] utilizes a retriever\\nand an LLM to calculate the probability distributions of the\\nretrieved documents and then performs supervised training\\nby computing the KL divergence. This straightforward and\\neffective training method enhances the performance of the\\nretrieval model by using an LM as the supervisory signal,\\neliminating the need for specific cross-attention mechanisms.\\nMoreover, inspired by RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from\\nHuman Feedback), utilizing LM-based feedback to reinforce\\nthe retriever through reinforcement learning.\\nE. Adapter\\nFine-tuning models may present challenges, such as in-\\ntegrating functionality through an API or addressing con-\\nstraints arising from limited local computational resources.\\nConsequently, some approaches opt to incorporate an external\\nadapter to aid in alignment.\\nTo optimize the multi-task capabilities of LLM, UP-\\nRISE [20] trained a lightweight prompt retriever that can\\nautomatically retrieve prompts from a pre-built prompt pool\\nthat are suitable for a given zero-shot task input. AAR\\n(Augmentation-Adapted Retriver) [47] introduces a universal\\nadapter designed to accommodate multiple downstream tasks.\\nWhile PRCA [69] add a pluggable reward-driven contextual\\nadapter to enhance performance on specific tasks. BGM [26]\\nkeeps the retriever and LLM fixed,and trains a bridge Seq2Seq\\nmodel in between. The bridge model aims to transform the\\nretrieved information into a format that LLMs can work with\\neffectively, allowing it to not only rerank but also dynami-\\ncally select passages for each query, and potentially employ\\nmore advanced strategies like repetition. Furthermore, PKG'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf_sources/pdf_data_source1.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='10\\nintroduces an innovative method for integrating knowledge\\ninto white-box models via directive fine-tuning [75]. In this\\napproach, the retriever module is directly substituted to gen-\\nerate relevant documents according to a query. This method\\nassists in addressing the difficulties encountered during the\\nfine-tuning process and enhances model performance.\\nIV. G ENERATION\\nAfter retrieval, it is not a good practice to directly input all\\nthe retrieved information to the LLM for answering questions.\\nFollowing will introduce adjustments from two perspectives:\\nadjusting the retrieved content and adjusting the LLM.\\nA. Context Curation\\nRedundant information can interfere with the final gener-\\nation of LLM, and overly long contexts can also lead LLM\\nto the “Lost in the middle” problem [98]. Like humans, LLM\\ntends to only focus on the beginning and end of long texts,\\nwhile forgetting the middle portion. Therefore, in the RAG\\nsystem, we typically need to further process the retrieved\\ncontent.\\n1) Reranking: Reranking fundamentally reorders document\\nchunks to highlight the most pertinent results first, effectively\\nreducing the overall document pool, severing a dual purpose\\nin information retrieval, acting as both an enhancer and a\\nfilter, delivering refined inputs for more precise language\\nmodel processing [70]. Reranking can be performed using\\nrule-based methods that depend on predefined metrics like\\nDiversity, Relevance, and MRR, or model-based approaches\\nlike Encoder-Decoder models from the BERT series (e.g.,\\nSpanBERT), specialized reranking models such as Cohere\\nrerank or bge-raranker-large, and general large language mod-\\nels like GPT [12], [99].\\n2) Context Selection/Compression: A common misconcep-\\ntion in the RAG process is the belief that retrieving as many\\nrelevant documents as possible and concatenating them to form\\na lengthy retrieval prompt is beneficial. However, excessive\\ncontext can introduce more noise, diminishing the LLM’s\\nperception of key information .\\n(Long) LLMLingua [100], [101] utilize small language\\nmodels (SLMs) such as GPT-2 Small or LLaMA-7B, to\\ndetect and remove unimportant tokens, transforming it into\\na form that is challenging for humans to comprehend but\\nwell understood by LLMs. This approach presents a direct\\nand practical method for prompt compression, eliminating the\\nneed for additional training of LLMs while balancing language\\nintegrity and compression ratio. PRCA tackled this issue by\\ntraining an information extractor [69]. Similarly, RECOMP\\nadopts a comparable approach by training an information\\ncondenser using contrastive learning [71]. Each training data\\npoint consists of one positive sample and five negative sam-\\nples, and the encoder undergoes training using contrastive loss\\nthroughout this process [102] .\\nIn addition to compressing the context, reducing the num-\\nber of documents aslo helps improve the accuracy of the\\nmodel’s answers. Ma et al. [103] propose the “Filter-Reranker”\\nparadigm, which combines the strengths of LLMs and SLMs.In this paradigm, SLMs serve as filters, while LLMs function\\nas reordering agents. The research shows that instructing\\nLLMs to rearrange challenging samples identified by SLMs\\nleads to significant improvements in various Information\\nExtraction (IE) tasks. Another straightforward and effective\\napproach involves having the LLM evaluate the retrieved\\ncontent before generating the final answer. This allows the\\nLLM to filter out documents with poor relevance through LLM\\ncritique. For instance, in Chatlaw [104], the LLM is prompted\\nto self-suggestion on the referenced legal provisions to assess\\ntheir relevance.\\nB. LLM Fine-tuning\\nTargeted fine-tuning based on the scenario and data char-\\nacteristics on LLMs can yield better results. This is also one\\nof the greatest advantages of using on-premise LLMs. When\\nLLMs lack data in a specific domain, additional knowledge can\\nbe provided to the LLM through fine-tuning. Huggingface’s\\nfine-tuning data can also be used as an initial step.\\nAnother benefit of fine-tuning is the ability to adjust the\\nmodel’s input and output. For example, it can enable LLM to\\nadapt to specific data formats and generate responses in a par-\\nticular style as instructed [37]. For retrieval tasks that engage\\nwith structured data, the SANTA framework [76] implements\\na tripartite training regimen to effectively encapsulate both\\nstructural and semantic nuances. The initial phase focuses on\\nthe retriever, where contrastive learning is harnessed to refine\\nthe query and document embeddings.\\nAligning LLM outputs with human or retriever preferences\\nthrough reinforcement learning is a potential approach. For\\ninstance, manually annotating the final generated answers\\nand then providing feedback through reinforcement learning.\\nIn addition to aligning with human preferences, it is also\\npossible to align with the preferences of fine-tuned models\\nand retrievers [79]. When circumstances prevent access to\\npowerful proprietary models or larger parameter open-source\\nmodels, a simple and effective method is to distill the more\\npowerful models(e.g. GPT-4). Fine-tuning of LLM can also\\nbe coordinated with fine-tuning of the retriever to align pref-\\nerences. A typical approach, such as RA-DIT [27], aligns the\\nscoring functions between Retriever and Generator using KL\\ndivergence.\\nV. A UGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG\\nIn the domain of RAG, the standard practice often involves\\na singular (once) retrieval step followed by generation, which\\ncan lead to inefficiencies and sometimes is typically insuffi-\\ncient for complex problems demanding multi-step reasoning,\\nas it provides a limited scope of information [105]. Many\\nstudies have optimized the retrieval process in response to this\\nissue, and we have summarised them in Figure 5.\\nA. Iterative Retrieval\\nIterative retrieval is a process where the knowledge base\\nis repeatedly searched based on the initial query and the text\\ngenerated so far, providing a more comprehensive knowledge'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf_sources/pdf_data_source1.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='11\\nFig. 5. In addition to the most common once retrieval, RAG also includes three types of retrieval augmentation processes. (left) Iterative retrieval involves\\nalternating between retrieval and generation, allowing for richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base at each step. (Middle) Recursive retrieval\\ninvolves gradually refining the user query and breaking down the problem into sub-problems, then continuously solving complex problems through retrieval\\nand generation. (Right) Adaptive retrieval focuses on enabling the RAG system to autonomously determine whether external knowledge retrieval is necessary\\nand when to stop retrieval and generation, often utilizing LLM-generated special tokens for control.\\nbase for LLMs. This approach has been shown to enhance\\nthe robustness of subsequent answer generation by offering\\nadditional contextual references through multiple retrieval\\niterations. However, it may be affected by semantic discon-\\ntinuity and the accumulation of irrelevant information. ITER-\\nRETGEN [14] employs a synergistic approach that lever-\\nages “retrieval-enhanced generation” alongside “generation-\\nenhanced retrieval” for tasks that necessitate the reproduction\\nof specific information. The model harnesses the content\\nrequired to address the input task as a contextual basis for\\nretrieving pertinent knowledge, which in turn facilitates the\\ngeneration of improved responses in subsequent iterations.\\nB. Recursive Retrieval\\nRecursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and\\nNLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results.\\nThe process involves iteratively refining search queries based\\non the results obtained from previous searches. Recursive\\nRetrieval aims to enhance the search experience by gradu-\\nally converging on the most pertinent information through a\\nfeedback loop. IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide\\nthe retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained\\nretrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that\\nsystematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query. It\\ncan be particularly useful in complex search scenarios where\\nthe user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where\\nthe information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The\\nrecursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning\\nand adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in\\nimproved satisfaction with the search outcomes.\\nTo address specific data scenarios, recursive retrieval and\\nmulti-hop retrieval techniques are utilized together. Recursiveretrieval involves a structured index to process and retrieve\\ndata in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing\\nsections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a\\nretrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary\\nretrieval within the document refines the search, embodying\\nthe recursive nature of the process. In contrast, multi-hop\\nretrieval is designed to delve deeper into graph-structured data\\nsources, extracting interconnected information [106].\\nC. Adaptive Retrieval\\nAdaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare [24] and\\nSelf-RAG [25], refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs\\nto actively determine the optimal moments and content for\\nretrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the\\ninformation sourced.\\nThese methods are part of a broader trend wherein\\nLLMs employ active judgment in their operations, as seen\\nin model agents like AutoGPT, Toolformer, and Graph-\\nToolformer [107]–[109]. Graph-Toolformer, for instance, di-\\nvides its retrieval process into distinct steps where LLMs\\nproactively use retrievers, apply Self-Ask techniques, and em-\\nploy few-shot prompts to initiate search queries. This proactive\\nstance allows LLMs to decide when to search for necessary\\ninformation, akin to how an agent utilizes tools.\\nWebGPT [110] integrates a reinforcement learning frame-\\nwork to train the GPT-3 model in autonomously using a\\nsearch engine during text generation. It navigates this process\\nusing special tokens that facilitate actions such as search\\nengine queries, browsing results, and citing references, thereby\\nexpanding GPT-3’s capabilities through the use of external\\nsearch engines. Flare automates timing retrieval by monitoring\\nthe confidence of the generation process, as indicated by the'),\n",

When the probability falls\\nbelow a certain threshold would activates the retrieval system\\nto collect relevant information, thus optimizing the retrieval\\ncycle. Self-RAG [25] introduces “reflection tokens” that allow\\nthe model to introspect its outputs. These tokens come in\\ntwo varieties: “retrieve” and “critic”. The model autonomously\\ndecides when to activate retrieval, or alternatively, a predefined\\nthreshold may trigger the process. During retrieval, the gen-\\nerator conducts a fragment-level beam search across multiple\\nparagraphs to derive the most coherent sequence. Critic scores\\nare used to update the subdivision scores, with the flexibility\\nto adjust these weights during inference, tailoring the model’s\\nbehavior. Self-RAG’s design obviates the need for additional\\nclassifiers or reliance on Natural Language Inference (NLI)\\nmodels, thus streamlining the decision-making process for\\nwhen to engage retrieval mechanisms and improving the\\nmodel’s autonomous judgment capabilities in generating ac-\\ncurate responses.\\nVI. T ASK AND EVALUATION\\nThe rapid advancement and growing adoption of RAG\\nin the field of NLP have propelled the evaluation of RAG\\nmodels to the forefront of research in the LLMs community.\\nThe primary objective of this evaluation is to comprehend\\nand optimize the performance of RAG models across diverse\\napplication scenarios.This chapter will mainly introduce the\\nmain downstream tasks of RAG, datasets, and how to evaluate\\nRAG systems.\\nA. Downstream Task\\nThe core task of RAG remains Question Answering (QA),\\nincluding traditional single-hop/multi-hop QA, multiple-\\nchoice, domain-specific QA as well as long-form scenarios\\nsuitable for RAG. In addition to QA, RAG is continuously\\nbeing expanded into multiple downstream tasks, such as Infor-\\nmation Extraction (IE), dialogue generation, code search, etc.\\nThe main downstream tasks of RAG and their corresponding\\ndatasets are summarized in Table II.\\nB. Evaluation Target\\nHistorically, RAG models assessments have centered on\\ntheir execution in specific downstream tasks. These evaluations\\nemploy established metrics suitable to the tasks at hand. For\\ninstance, question answering evaluations might rely on EM\\nand F1 scores [7], [45], [59], [72], whereas fact-checking\\ntasks often hinge on Accuracy as the primary metric [4],\\n[14], [42]. BLEU and ROUGE metrics are also commonly\\nused to evaluate answer quality [26], [32], [52], [78]. Tools\\nlike RALLE, designed for the automatic evaluation of RAG\\napplications, similarly base their assessments on these task-\\nspecific metrics [160]. Despite this, there is a notable paucity\\nof research dedicated to evaluating the distinct characteristics\\nof RAG models.The main evaluation objectives include:\\nRetrieval Quality . Evaluating the retrieval quality is crucial\\nfor determining the effectiveness of the context sourced by\\nthe retriever component. Standard metrics from the domainsof search engines, recommendation systems, and information\\nretrieval systems are employed to measure the performance of\\nthe RAG retrieval module. Metrics such as Hit Rate, MRR, and\\nNDCG are commonly utilized for this purpose [161], [162].\\nGeneration Quality . The assessment of generation quality\\ncenters on the generator’s capacity to synthesize coherent and\\nrelevant answers from the retrieved context. This evaluation\\ncan be categorized based on the content’s objectives: unlabeled\\nand labeled content. For unlabeled content, the evaluation\\nencompasses the faithfulness, relevance, and non-harmfulness\\nof the generated answers. In contrast, for labeled content,\\nthe focus is on the accuracy of the information produced by\\nthe model [161]. Additionally, both retrieval and generation\\nquality assessments can be conducted through manual or\\nautomatic evaluation methods [29], [161], [163].\\nC. Evaluation Aspects\\nContemporary evaluation practices of RAG models empha-\\nsize three primary quality scores and four essential abilities,\\nwhich collectively inform the evaluation of the two principal\\ntargets of the RAG model: retrieval and generation.\\n1) Quality Scores: Quality scores include context rele-\\nvance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance.

It is essential to recognize that these\\nmetrics, derived from related work, are traditional measures\\nand do not yet represent a mature or standardized approach for\\nquantifying RAG evaluation aspects. Custom metrics tailored\\nto the nuances of RAG models, though not included here, have\\nalso been developed in some evaluation studies.\\nD. Evaluation Benchmarks and Tools\\nA series of benchmark tests and tools have been proposed\\nto facilitate the evaluation of RAG.These instruments furnish\\nquantitative metrics that not only gauge RAG model perfor-\\nmance but also enhance comprehension of the model’s capabil-\\nities across various evaluation aspects. Prominent benchmarks\\nsuch as RGB, RECALL and CRUD [167]–[169] focus on\\nappraising the essential abilities of RAG models. Concur-\\nrently, state-of-the-art automated tools like RAGAS [164],\\nARES [165], and TruLens8employ LLMs to adjudicate the\\nquality scores. These tools and benchmarks collectively form\\na robust framework for the systematic evaluation of RAG\\nmodels, as summarized in Table IV.\\nVII. D ISCUSSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS\\nDespite the considerable progress in RAG technology, sev-\\neral challenges persist that warrant in-depth research.This\\nchapter will mainly introduce the current challenges and future\\nresearch directions faced by RAG.\\nA. RAG vs Long Context\\nWith the deepening of related research, the context of LLMs\\nis continuously expanding [170]–[172]. Presently, LLMs can\\neffortlessly manage contexts exceeding 200,000 tokens9. This\\ncapability signifies that long-document question answering,\\npreviously reliant on RAG, can now incorporate the entire\\ndocument directly into the prompt. This has also sparked\\ndiscussions on whether RAG is still necessary when LLMs\\n8https://www.trulens.org/trulens eval/core concepts ragtriad/\\n9https://kimi.moonshot.cnare not constrained by context. In fact, RAG still plays an\\nirreplaceable role. On one hand, providing LLMs with a\\nlarge amount of context at once will significantly impact its\\ninference speed, while chunked retrieval and on-demand input\\ncan significantly improve operational efficiency. On the other\\nhand, RAG-based generation can quickly locate the original\\nreferences for LLMs to help users verify the generated an-\\nswers. The entire retrieval and reasoning process is observable,\\nwhile generation solely relying on long context remains a\\nblack box. Conversely, the expansion of context provides new\\nopportunities for the development of RAG, enabling it to\\naddress more complex problems and integrative or summary\\nquestions that require reading a large amount of material to\\nanswer [49]. Developing new RAG methods in the context of\\nsuper-long contexts is one of the future research trends.\\nB. RAG Robustness\\nThe presence of noise or contradictory information during\\nretrieval can detrimentally affect RAG’s output quality. This\\nsituation is figuratively referred to as “Misinformation can\\nbe worse than no information at all”. Improving RAG’s\\nresistance to such adversarial or counterfactual inputs is gain-\\ning research momentum and has become a key performance\\nmetric [48], [50], [82]. Cuconasu et al. [54] analyze which\\ntype of documents should be retrieved, evaluate the relevance\\nof the documents to the prompt, their position, and the\\nnumber included in the context. The research findings reveal\\nthat including irrelevant documents can unexpectedly increase\\naccuracy by over 30%, contradicting the initial assumption\\nof reduced quality. These results underscore the importance\\nof developing specialized strategies to integrate retrieval with\\nlanguage generation models, highlighting the need for further\\nresearch and exploration into the robustness of RAG.\\nC. Hybrid Approaches\\nCombining RAG with fine-tuning is emerging as a leading\\nstrategy.

Readers are encouraged to consult pertinent literature for the specific quantification formulas associated with these\\nmetrics, as required.\\nand non-parameterized advantages are areas ripe for explo-\\nration [27]. Another trend is to introduce SLMs with specific\\nfunctionalities into RAG and fine-tuned by the results of RAG\\nsystem. For example, CRAG [67] trains a lightweight retrieval\\nevaluator to assess the overall quality of the retrieved docu-\\nments for a query and triggers different knowledge retrieval\\nactions based on confidence levels.\\nD. Scaling laws of RAG\\nEnd-to-end RAG models and pre-trained models based\\non RAG are still one of the focuses of current re-\\nsearchers [173].The parameters of these models are one of\\nthe key factors.While scaling laws [174] are established for\\nLLMs, their applicability to RAG remains uncertain. Initial\\nstudies like RETRO++ [44] have begun to address this, yet the\\nparameter count in RAG models still lags behind that of LLMs.\\nThe possibility of an Inverse Scaling Law10, where smaller\\nmodels outperform larger ones, is particularly intriguing and\\nmerits further investigation.\\nE. Production-Ready RAG\\nRAG’s practicality and alignment with engineering require-\\nments have facilitated its adoption. However, enhancing re-\\ntrieval efficiency, improving document recall in large knowl-\\nedge bases, and ensuring data security—such as preventing\\n10https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prizeinadvertent disclosure of document sources or metadata by\\nLLMs—are critical engineering challenges that remain to be\\naddressed [175].\\nThe development of the RAG ecosystem is greatly impacted\\nby the progression of its technical stack. Key tools like\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex have quickly gained popularity\\nwith the emergence of ChatGPT, providing extensive RAG-\\nrelated APIs and becoming essential in the realm of LLMs.The\\nemerging technology stack, while not as rich in features as\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex, stands out through its specialized\\nproducts. For example, Flowise AI prioritizes a low-code\\napproach, allowing users to deploy AI applications, including\\nRAG, through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. Other\\ntechnologies like HayStack, Meltano, and Cohere Coral are\\nalso gaining attention for their unique contributions to the field.\\nIn addition to AI-focused vendors, traditional software and\\ncloud service providers are expanding their offerings to include\\nRAG-centric services. Weaviate’s Verba11is designed for\\npersonal assistant applications, while Amazon’s Kendra12\\noffers intelligent enterprise search services, enabling users to\\nbrowse various content repositories using built-in connectors.\\nIn the development of RAG technology, there is a clear\\ntrend towards different specialization directions, such as: 1)\\nCustomization - tailoring RAG to meet specific requirements.\\n2) Simplification - making RAG easier to use to reduce the\\n11https://github.com/weaviate/Verba\\n12https://aws.amazon.com/cn/kendra/'),\n",

RAG toolkits are converging into a\\nfoundational technology stack, laying the groundwork for\\nadvanced enterprise applications. However, a fully integrated,\\ncomprehensive platform concept is still in the future, requiring\\nfurther innovation and development.\\nF . Multi-modal RAG\\nRAG has transcended its initial text-based question-\\nanswering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data.\\nThis expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models\\nthat integrate RAG concepts across various domains:\\nImage . RA-CM3 [176] stands as a pioneering multimodal\\nmodel of both retrieving and generating text and images.\\nBLIP-2 [177] leverages frozen image encoders alongside\\nLLMs for efficient visual language pre-training, enabling zero-\\nshot image-to-text conversions. The “Visualize Before You\\nWrite” method [178] employs image generation to steer the\\nLM’s text generation, showing promise in open-ended text\\ngeneration tasks.\\nAudio and Video . The GSS method retrieves and stitches\\ntogether audio clips to convert machine-translated data into\\nspeech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant ad-\\nvancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by\\nincorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text con-\\nversion [180]. Additionally, KNN-based attention fusion lever-\\nages audio embeddings and semantically related text embed-\\ndings to refine ASR, thereby accelerating domain adaptation.Vid2Seq augments language models with specialized temporal\\nmarkers, facilitating the prediction of event boundaries and\\ntextual descriptions within a unified output sequence [181].\\nCode . RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by\\nretrieving code examples that align with developers’ objectives\\nthrough encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has\\ndemonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion genera-\\ntion and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK\\nmethod [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query\\nfrom a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints\\nwithin the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph\\nquestion-answering tasks.\\nVIII. C ONCLUSION\\nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, empha-\\nsizes RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the capa-\\nbilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from\\nlanguage models with extensive non-parameterized data from\\nexternal knowledge bases. The survey showcases the evolution\\nof RAG technologies and their application on many different\\ntasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms\\nwithin the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modu-\\nlar RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over\\nits predecessors. RAG’s technical integration with other AI\\nmethodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,\\nhas further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in\\nRAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve\\nits robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts.\\nRAG’s application scope is expanding into multimodal do-\\nmains, adapting its principles to interpret and process diverse\\ndata forms like images, videos, and code. This expansion high-\\nlights RAG’s significant practical implications for AI deploy-\\nment, attracting interest from academic and industrial sectors.'),\n",

This paper investigates the \\nRetrieval -Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, providing insights into its modular design and the impact of its \\nconstituent modules on performance. Leveraging a unique dataset from Amazon Rainforest natives and biologists, our \\nresearch demonstrates the signiﬁcance of preserving indigenous cultures and biodiversity. The experiment employs a \\ncustomizable RAG methodology, allowing for the interchangeability of various components, such as the base language \\nmodel and similarity score tools. Findings indicate that while GPT  performs slightly better when given context, Palm \\nexhibits superior performance without context. The results also suggest that models tend to perform optimally when \\npaired with similarity scores from their native platforms. Conclusively, our approach show cases the potential of a \\nmodular RAG design in optimizing language models, presenting it as a more advantageous strategy compared to tra-\\nditional ﬁne -tuning of large language models.  \\nIntroduction  \\nThe evolution of natural language processing models has seen signiﬁcant strides from rule -based approaches in the \\nearly stages of language understanding, eventually leading to the advent of neural networks. However, the full potential \\nof these neural netw orks awaited the computational infrastructure to catch up. The pivotal moment arrived with the \\nemergence of neural machine translation (NMT), exempliﬁed by Google Translate, which marked a turning point in \\nmachine language comprehension (Bahdanau, 2016) . Subsequently, a plethora of advanced models, including BERT, \\nTransformers, GPT -2, and GPT -3, have emerged, driving the ﬁeld forward. Recent notable additions to this landscape \\nare models like GPT  and Bard  (Devlin, 2018) (Vaswani, 2017)  (Radford, 2018) . While ﬁne -tuning such models has \\nproven to be a challenging endeavor, it has become evident that Retrieval -Augmented Generation (RAG) oﬀers a prom-\\nising alternative  (Lewis, 2020)  (Siriwardhana, 2023)  (Yu, 2022) . \\nCuriously, little attention has been devoted to dissecting the individual components of RAG and their respec-\\ntive impacts on overall performance. In response to this gap, our paper undertakes a comprehensive investigation of \\nthe RAG framework and embarks on the design of RAG models from the ground up, with a focus on the modularity \\nand replaceability of its constituent modules. This research seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the mech-\\nanisms underlying RAG and its potential for enhancing natural  language understanding and generation. These Large \\nLanguage Models ( LLMs) exhibit a remarkable proﬁciency in replicating human language styles, achieving a level of \\nlinguistic verisimilitude that borders on the impeccable. In light of these capabilities, it is prudent to delve into the \\nprofound signiﬁcance of the Amazon rainforest, which equates to the importance of any ethnically or racially diverse \\nnation across the globe. Within the vast expanse of the Amazon, an intricate tapestry of life unfolds, where millions \\nof distinct species intermingle. Each of these species, as rare as the other, holds a unique and intrinsic value to the \\nindigenous populations who have made this ecosystem their home. The Amazon rainforest is not only a cradle of \\nbiological diversity but also a sanctuary for an array of religions and cultures, many of which teeter on the brink of \\nVolume 12 Issue 4 (2023) \\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org/hs\\n1\\n'),\n",

Preserving the Amazon is not merely an environmental imperative; it is an act of justice to the indigenous \\ncommunities whose ancestral lands are enshrined within its boundaries. It is a call to safeguard the memories of the \\nland, the traditions that have evolved within its embrace, and the very essence of their cultures. However, certain \\nregions of the Amazon remain shrouded in obscurity, their ﬂora and fauna so rare that reliable and readily available \\ninformation is conspicuously lacking in the vast repository of knowledge available on the internet. In this context, \\nadvanced LLMs play an instrumental role in addressing this deﬁcit by facilitating the dissemination of indigenous \\nnarratives and thereby amplifying awareness and appreciation of the rich tapestry of beliefs, practices, and traditional \\nknowledge that these communities hold dear. They serve as a bridge connecting the indigenous Amazonian cultures \\nwith the global community, emphasizing the paramount importance of preserving the cultural diversity interwoven \\nwithin this vast rainforest. In sum, the overarching mission of this endeavor is twofold: to document and educate the \\nWestern world about hitherto unknown cultures while concurrently ensuring the enduring preservation of these inval-\\nuable facets of human heritage and biodiversity.  \\n \\nProposed Experiment  \\n \\nBackground and Importance \\n \\nThe intrinsic value of indigenous knowledge, especially from regions as biodiverse and culturally rich as the Amazon \\nRainforest, cannot be overstated. This knowledge, passed down through generations, encompasses not only cultural \\nand religious beliefs but also practical insights into the local ﬂora and fauna. As the modern world encroaches on these \\nlands, this wisdom is in peril of being lost forever. Recognizing this, our proposed experiment aims to employ a state -\\nof-the-art Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to capture and leverage this  vast, yet vulnerable, \\nknowledge base.  \\nOur dataset, derived from interviews with Amazon Rainforest natives and biologists, is unparalleled in its \\ndepth and breadth. It includes detailed discussions on religious practices, cultural nuances, and the integral role of the \\nsurrounding ecosystem in the daily lives of these communities. This data is not just a scientiﬁc or anthropological \\nresource; it is a repository of living history and an urgent call to action for preservation eﬀorts.  \\nBy integrating this unique dataset into the RAG framework, we anticipate not only the preservation of \\nknowledge but also the generation of responses that reﬂect the rich tapestry of Amazonian life. The experiment is \\ndesigned to evaluate how diﬀerent components within the RAG setup—such as base language models and similarity \\nscoring algorithms —can be optimized to reﬂect the nuances captured within our dataset. In doing so, we aim to bridge \\nthe gap between advanced language models and the profound human insig hts found within the Amazon.  \\nThe central objective of our experiment is twofold: to analyze the performance implications of modular design \\nwithin the RAG framework and to demonstrate the profound capability of such a system to preserve and communicate \\nthe wealth of indigenous knowledg e. We hypothesize that a customizable RAG model will not only facilitate a deeper \\nunderstanding of the data but also allow us to ﬁne -tune the system for optimal performance across diﬀerent conﬁgu-\\nrations.  To achieve this, we will systematically explore the interchangeability of various RAG components. We will \\nassess diﬀerent base language models such as GPT  and Palm and  compare the eﬃcacy of similarity scoring tools from \\ndiverse platforms. The experiment will rigorously test these combinations, identifying which synergies most eﬀectively \\ncapture the essence of the dataset.  \\nThe ultimate goal is to showcase the potential of a modular RAG system in processing culturally signiﬁcant \\ninformation, paving the way for future applications that can beneﬁt from such tailored language models. We anticipate \\nthat our ﬁndings will contribute signiﬁcantly to the ﬁelds of computational linguistics  and cultural preservation, demon-\\nstrating a novel approach to the application of large language models.  \\n \\n  \\nVolume 12 Issue 4 (2023) \\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org/hs\\n2\\n'),\n",

It is a rich compendium of verbal histories, inter-\\nviews, and ecological insights gathered from the indigenous peoples of the Amazon Rainforest, as well as from biolo-\\ngists and ecologists dedicated to studying this unique biome. The dataset is characterized by its diversity, comprising \\nnarratives that elucidate the intricate relationship between the natives and their environment, including the religious \\nand cultural signiﬁcance of plant and animal life.  \\nThe data collection was an extensive process, where linguists and researchers engaged in deep conversations \\nwith the natives, recording their dialects, translating their stories, and documenting their knowledge of the ecological \\nsystem. Similarly, biologis ts contributed their decades of research on the ﬂora and fauna, providing a scientiﬁc per-\\nspective to the indigenous narratives. The data thus forms a conﬂuence of traditional wisdom and modern scientiﬁc \\nunderstanding, oﬀering a 360- degree view of the Amazon Rainforest's ecosystem.  \\n \\nCultural and Environmental Signiﬁcance \\n \\nThe urgency of preserving indigenous knowledge is akin to conserving an endangered species. It is a race against time, \\nas globalization and environmental degradation threaten to erase unique cultures and the wisdom they hold. Our dataset \\nserves as a digital ark, a means to preserve and perpetuate the knowledge that has sustained the Amazon's communities \\nfor m illennia.  \\nThe environmental signiﬁcance of the Amazon Rainforest cannot be overstated—it is a keystone of global \\nbiodiversity. By documenting the intricate knowledge,  the natives have of their environment, we are also chronicling \\nthe ecological interdependencies that are vital for the rainforest's survival. This dataset, therefore, is not just an aca-\\ndemic or technological asset; it is a critical record for environmental conservationists and policymakers.  \\nThrough our experiment, we aim to amplify the voices of the Amazon's indigenous peoples, whose under-\\nstanding of their habitat is unmatched. By integrating their knowledge into the RAG framework, we hope to create a \\nmodel that not only responds with information but also with wisdom  that respects the interconnectedness of life and \\nculture.  \\n \\nRetrieval -Augmented Generation Framework \\n \\nThe heart of our experiment lies in the Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, a sophisticated algorithm \\nthat enables the deconstruction of the language model into discrete, interchangeable components. This framework \\nintegrates a retriever model t hat sources relevant context and a generator model that synthesizes the retrieved infor-\\nmation into coherent responses.  \\nIn mathematical terms, given an input query 𝑞𝑞, the retriever model searches a knowledge base 𝒦𝒦 and retrieves \\na set of relevant documents 𝐷𝐷={𝑑𝑑1,𝑑𝑑2,…,𝑑𝑑𝑘𝑘}. Each document  𝑑𝑑 is represented as a vector  𝐯𝐯𝑑𝑑 in a high -dimensional \\nspace, obtained from an embedding layer. This process transforms the raw text data into a structured form amenable \\nto computational manipulation. \\nTo examine the eﬀects of component interchangeability, we adopt various base language models and similar-\\nity scoring mechanisms. For instance, if 𝐸𝐸denotes the embedding function, and  𝑠𝑠 and 𝑡𝑡 represent the input and target \\ntext sequences, respectively, their vector representations would be  𝐯𝐯𝑠𝑠=𝐸𝐸(𝑠𝑠) and 𝐯𝐯𝑡𝑡=𝐸𝐸(𝑡𝑡). We employ cosine simi-\\nlarity as the basis for our similarity score, deﬁned by the formula:  \\nsimilarity (𝐯𝐯𝑠𝑠,𝐯𝐯𝑡𝑡)=𝐯𝐯𝑠𝑠 ⋅𝐯𝐯𝑡𝑡\\n�|v𝑠𝑠|� �|v𝑡𝑡|� \\nHere,  ⋅ denotes the dot product between the two vectors, and �|⋅|� denotes the Euclidean norm. This score quantiﬁes \\nthe closeness of the semantic meaning represented by the vectors, with a value of 1 indicating identical directionality \\nand thus, maximal similarity.   \\nVolume 12 Issue 4 (2023) \\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org/hs\\n3\\n\"),\n",

By com-\\nparing the performance of diﬀerent  𝐸𝐸 choices, we can identify which embeddings yield the most semantically rich \\nrepresentations for our unique dataset.  \\n \\nExperiment Setup  \\n \\nThe experiment commences with the training of the language models using our unique dataset. For the training phase, \\nwe deﬁne the following:  \\nℒ: The base language model, which can be either GPT  or Palm.  \\n𝒟𝒟: The training dataset, consisting of pairs  (𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖,𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖) where  𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 is a query from the dataset and 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 is the corresponding \\nanswer.  \\nThe language model ℒ is ﬁne -tuned on 𝒟𝒟, optimizing the weights to minimize the loss function, typically a \\ncross -entropy loss between the predicted and actual answers.   \\nFollowing training, the question -answering process involves feeding a new query 𝑞𝑞′ to the trained model and retrieving \\nthe answer  𝑎𝑎′. This answer is then compared to a predeﬁned list of correct answers using the similarity score, which is \\nfundamental to evaluating the model's performance.  \\n \\nBenchmarking and Evaluation \\n \\nThe evaluation metric for our experiment is based on the similarity scores between the generated responses and a set \\nof reference answers. Let  𝐴𝐴={𝑎𝑎1′,𝑎𝑎2′,…,𝑎𝑎𝑛𝑛′} be the set of answers generated by the model, and  𝐴𝐴ref={𝑎𝑎1∗,𝑎𝑎2∗,…,𝑎𝑎𝑛𝑛∗} \\nbe the set of reference answers. We deﬁne the average similarity score as follows : \\nScoreavg=1\\nn�similarity (𝐯𝐯𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖′,𝐯𝐯𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖∗)𝑛𝑛\\n𝑖𝑖=1 \\nThis average score acts as the primary benchmark for comparing diﬀerent model conﬁgurations. We systematically \\nrecord the scores across various combinations of language models and similarity scoring mechanisms to assess which \\nconﬁgurations yield the highest average similarity, indicating the most eﬀective model se tup for our dataset.  \\nAdditionally, we account for the presence or absence of context in the model's training and response genera-\\ntion. This is critical, as the presence of context has been shown to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence model performance, particu-\\nlarly in the domain of indigenous knowledge and biodiversity, where context provides essential background information \\nthat can drastically aﬀect the meaning and relevance of a response.  \\nThrough this meticulous experimental setup, we aim to illuminate the intricate dynamics between diﬀerent \\ncomponents of the RAG framework and their collective impact on the model's ability to accurately replicate and convey \\nthe richness of the Amazon Rainforest's cultural and ecological knowledge.  \\n \\nPre-Experiment Performance Expectations and Discussion  \\n \\nIn the landscape of varying conﬁgurations, we hypothesize that certain setups will yield higher average similarity \\nscores than others, indicative of more nuanced and accurate language generation. Particularly, we expect that:  \\nThe similarity scores for models trained with contextual data 𝐯𝐯context  will surpass those trained without, due to the \\nenriched understanding and background the model has of the subject matter.  \\nWhen aligning models with their native embeddings (e.g., GPT  with OpenAI Embed, Palm with Palm Em-\\nbed), the semantic vector representations  (𝐯𝐯𝑠𝑠,𝐯𝐯𝑡𝑡) should align more closely, thus producing higher similarity scores.  \\nThe modular nature of the RAG setup will reveal that certain combinations of base language models and similarity \\nscoring mechanisms are more eﬀective than others, depending on whether context is included or not.  \\nVolume 12 Issue 4 (2023) \\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org/hs\\n4\\n\"),\n",

Mathematically, we can represent our hypothesis as:  \\nScoreavg ,context >Scor eavg ,no context +∆context  \\nScoreavg ,native >Scor eavg ,non−native +∆native  \\nThese hypotheses will be tested through a series of experiments, allowing us to determine the optimal model conﬁgu-\\nration for processing and generating responses reﬂective of the Amazon Rainforest dataset.  \\n \\nPotential Implications for LLMs  \\n \\nThe results of this experiment are expected to have signiﬁcant implications for the development and ﬁne -tuning of \\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). By identifying the most eﬀective conﬁgurations, we can oﬀer insights into the adapt-\\nability of these models to specialized datasets, which is crucial for applic ations that require a high degree of cultural \\nand contextual sensitivity. \\nMoreover, the experiment is poised to challenge the prevailing approach to LLM training and ﬁne -tuning, \\nwhich often relies on static, one -size-ﬁts-all models. Our ﬁndings could suggest a shift towards a more dynamic, com-\\nponent -based approach, allowing f or greater ﬂexibility and precision in model performance across diverse domains.  \\nThe potential success of the RAG framework in this context may also pave the way for more granular im-\\nprovements in LLMs, beyond the standard metrics of accuracy and ﬂuency.

It serves as a testament to the power of advanced computational techniques in preserving the rich tapestry \\nof human culture, particularly the imperiled knowledge of the Amazon Rainforest's indigenous peoples. By success-\\nfully training a language model to accurately reﬂect and communicate this knowledge, we not only preserve it for future \\ngenerations but also validate the importance of linguistic and cultural diversity in our global ecosystem.  \\nThis experiment, should it succeed, will demonstrate a practical application of LLMs in the service of cultural \\npreservation. It emphasizes the role that technology can play in safeguarding intangible heritage, a mission that aligns \\nwith the broader objectives of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage initiatives. It serves as a model for how com-\\nmunities around the world can leverage technology to protect and share their unique cultural identities and knowledge \\nsystems.  \\n \\nAdvancements in RAG Framework  \\n \\nFrom a methodological standpoint, our experiment is poised to contribute to the advancement of the RAG framework \\nwithin the realm of AI language models.

This adaptability is critical as the \\ndemand for LLMs expands into increasingly varied and complex domains, from legal and medical to historical and \\nanthropological.  \\nFurthermore, the experiment's focus on modularity could inspire a new wave of research into component -\\nbased architectures for LLMs. Such architectures may provide a more sustainable and eﬃcient pathway to model im-\\nprovement, as opposed to the computationa lly intensive process of training large models from scratch.  \\nVolume 12 Issue 4 (2023) \\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org/hs\\n5\\n\"),\n",

However, now \\nas they become more and more complex to tune models like OpenAI ’s GPT  and Google’s Bard have been plateauing \\nperformance wise.  \\n \\nTab\\nle 1. Experimental Results.

This allows the user to add certain parts / combina-\\ntions to test the performance of those then to substitute diﬀerent modules in to see which leads to the largest perfor-\\nmance  increase over the other. These customizable steps allow you to see minute diﬀerences in performance that slowly \\ntuning a model couldn’t have shown you previously. This is a novel way to approach the tuning of LLM and will only \\nserve to increase their acc uracy as time moves forward.  \\nAnother major component of our RAG methodology is the ability to switch out which embedding layer you \\nuse. The standard embedding ( OpenAI ) or Palm’s embed. When choosing between both of those some tradeoﬀs are \\nmade.  \\nWhen using no context, Palm’s embedding layer seems to perform much better across the board, allowing for \\na much higher average similarity score, however this drastically shifts when given context as now OpenAI ’s embedding \\nlayer performs much more soundly. The evidence for these claims is discussed later in this paper.  \\nAdditionally, another beneﬁcial feature of the RAG optimization and breakdown style is the ability to cus-\\ntomize which similarity score the LLM uses to decide which answer to base its response oﬀ from the Q -A list. To go \\ninto further detail, the code when  prompted with a user question compares the user question to the Q -A list and reorders \\nthe list based oﬀ highest similarity score to lowest, this allows the LLM to select the top 2 -3 answers to  the highest \\nranked questions and continue generating its own response from there.  \\nThe ﬁrst choice of similarity score was STS OpenAI Score while the second was STS Palm Score. In terms \\nof the data when GPT  (for the purposes of precision all of the following results include context) and STS OpenAI  were \\ncombined, you got an average similarity score of 0.997. If you instead pair this with Palm STS Score instead, the \\naverage score drops to 0.92, a 0.077 decrease in performance. A similar eﬀect when using Palm with Palm STS and \\nPalm with OpenAI  STS (0.996 versus 0.93, respectively). This data demonstrates that both Palm and OpenAI  are able \\nVolume 12 Issue 4 (2023) \\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org/hs\\n7\\n'),\n",

What is also interest-\\ning to note is that although Palm produced a 0.001 lower performance than GPT  it seemed to be more ﬂexible, working \\nbetter with its competitor (OpenAI  STS Score + Palm produced 0.93) than the GPT  with its competitor (Palm STS \\nScore + GPT  produced 0.92).  \\nTo recap on the experimental setup, this code uses an interchangeable piece of a LLM so you can swap or \\nreplace things like the embedding layer used, the similarity score used, and the base language model used, also whether \\nit was given context from the Q -A database or not. This is a novel and important way to be able to break down LLM \\nand the data collected speaks a lot to the importance of each aspect of an  LLM.  \\nIn terms of expected results, two things were noticed, ﬁrst that Palm had a slightly lower performance than \\nGPT  (0.996 versus 0.997 respectively) on their top runs, however, there was also some contradictory data as it seemed \\nthat Palm worked signiﬁcantly better when given no context to work with compared to GPT, Palm produced an average \\nscore of 0.88 and 0.91 when given no context while GPT  produced an average score of 0.75 and 0.897. Although GPT  \\nmay perform much better when given context, Palm seems to beat it out just given its own proprietary dataset (no \\ncontext).  \\nSome unexpected results occurred with pairing GPT  and Palm with their opposite embeds, for example, pair-\\ning Palm with OpenAI embed. While on paper it makes sense that Palm would work better with Palm embed, it actually \\nperformed better when paired with OpenAI ’s embed. 0.91 (with OpenAI  embed) versus 0.88 (Palm embed) —note that \\nthis is without context given. A similar eﬀect was noticed going the other way around as well, without context, GPT  \\nperformed much better with Palm embedding layer than with its own OpenAI  embedding layer (0.897 versus 0.75 \\nrespectively). This data shows how Palm embedding layer tends to perform much better given no context when com-\\npared to OpenAI ’s embed. Similarly,  to explored above, it is the opposite when given context,  however. OpenAI ’s \\nembedding layer performs a bit better when given context across the board than Palm embed.  \\nMost notably from this experiment was two realizations. First, that Palm Embedding layer tends to work much \\nbetter when just given its own proprietary dataset (and no context), when compared to OpenAI’s embed. Additionally, \\nwhen given context, the playing ﬁeld switches: Palm tends to perform much worse when given context when compared \\nto OpenAI . Lastly, it is important to note that a combination of Palm/ GPT  with OpenAI ’s embedding layer and context \\nyielded extremely accurate results when its similarity scores were averaged.  \\n \\nConclusion  \\n \\nBuilding upon the foundation laid by our initial ﬁndings, it is paramount to recognize the exceptional performance of \\nthe Palm model when utilizing its proprietary dataset in conjunction with the Palm embed. This speciﬁcity in data and \\ntechnology synchronization has shown that Palm outshines OpenAI in terms of model accuracy in a context -free envi-\\nronment. However, the landscape shifts when contextual data is integrated. In such scenarios, the combination of GPT \\nwith its native OpenAI embedding layer  excels, leveraging the additional context to produce responses of remarkable \\naccuracy that resonate with the cultural and ecological nuances of the Amazon.  \\nThis pivot in performance based on context underscores the signiﬁcance of tailored datasets and embedding \\nmechanisms in the optimization of Large Language Models (LLMs). The adaptability of the Retrieval -Augmented \\nGeneration (RAG) framework emerges as a c ornerstone for future enhancements in LLMs. By enabling the seamless \\ninterchange of model components, RAG presents an evolutionary leap in the ﬁne -tuning of language models, catering \\nto the intricate demands of culturally rich and contextually complex datasets.  \\nIn light of these advancements, our research signiﬁes a pivotal moment for LLMs. The evidence suggests that \\nwhen models are ﬁnely tuned with an awareness of the dataset's inherent context and the corresponding embedding \\nlayers, they reach new heights of linguistic precision. Therefore, the path forward for LLMs lies in embracing the \\nmodular and contextually aware RAG framework, which promises to reﬁne the capabilities of language models to an \\nunprecedented degree, ensuring the preservation and celebration of the world's diverse linguistic and cultural heritage.  \\nVolume 12 Issue 4 (2023) \\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org/hs\\n8\\n\"),\n",

Input the original question and the retrieved chunks together into LLM to generate the final answer.\\nwidespread adoption of ChatGPT. The Naive RAG follows\\na traditional process that includes indexing, retrieval, and\\ngeneration, which is also characterized as a “Retrieve-Read”\\nframework [7].\\nIndexing starts with the cleaning and extraction of raw data\\nin diverse formats like PDF, HTML, Word, and Markdown,\\nwhich is then converted into a uniform plain text format. To\\naccommodate the context limitations of language models, text\\nis segmented into smaller, digestible chunks. Chunks are then\\nencoded into vector representations using an embedding model\\nand stored in vector database. This step is crucial for enabling\\nefficient similarity searches in the subsequent retrieval phase.\\nRetrieval . Upon receipt of a user query, the RAG system\\nemploys the same encoding model utilized during the indexing\\nphase to transform the query into a vector representation.\\nIt then computes the similarity scores between the query\\nvector and the vector of chunks within the indexed corpus.\\nThe system prioritizes and retrieves the top K chunks that\\ndemonstrate the greatest similarity to the query. These chunks\\nare subsequently used as the expanded context in prompt.\\nGeneration . The posed query and selected documents are\\nsynthesized into a coherent prompt to which a large language\\nmodel is tasked with formulating a response. The model’s\\napproach to answering may vary depending on task-specific\\ncriteria, allowing it to either draw upon its inherent parametric\\nknowledge or restrict its responses to the information con-\\ntained within the provided documents. In cases of ongoing\\ndialogues, any existing conversational history can be integrated\\ninto the prompt, enabling the model to engage in multi-turn\\ndialogue interactions effectively.\\nHowever, Naive RAG encounters notable drawbacks:Retrieval Challenges . The retrieval phase often struggles\\nwith precision and recall, leading to the selection of misaligned\\nor irrelevant chunks, and the missing of crucial information.\\nGeneration Difficulties . In generating responses, the model\\nmay face the issue of hallucination, where it produces con-\\ntent not supported by the retrieved context. This phase can\\nalso suffer from irrelevance, toxicity, or bias in the outputs,\\ndetracting from the quality and reliability of the responses.\\nAugmentation Hurdles . Integrating retrieved information\\nwith the different task can be challenging, sometimes resulting\\nin disjointed or incoherent outputs. The process may also\\nencounter redundancy when similar information is retrieved\\nfrom multiple sources, leading to repetitive responses. Deter-\\nmining the significance and relevance of various passages and\\nensuring stylistic and tonal consistency add further complexity.\\nFacing complex issues, a single retrieval based on the original\\nquery may not suffice to acquire adequate context information.\\nMoreover, there’s a concern that generation models might\\noverly rely on augmented information, leading to outputs that\\nsimply echo retrieved content without adding insightful or\\nsynthesized information.\\nB.

(Left) Naive RAG mainly consists of three parts: indexing, retrieval and generation. (Middle)\\nAdvanced RAG proposes multiple optimization strategies around pre-retrieval and post-retrieval, with a process similar to the Naive RAG, still following a\\nchain-like structure. (Right) Modular RAG inherits and develops from the previous paradigm, showcasing greater flexibility overall. This is evident in the\\nintroduction of multiple specific functional modules and the replacement of existing modules. The overall process is not limited to sequential retrieval and\\ngeneration; it includes methods such as iterative and adaptive retrieval.\\nPre-retrieval process . In this stage, the primary focus is\\non optimizing the indexing structure and the original query.\\nThe goal of optimizing indexing is to enhance the quality of\\nthe content being indexed. This involves strategies: enhancing\\ndata granularity, optimizing index structures, adding metadata,\\nalignment optimization, and mixed retrieval. While the goal\\nof query optimization is to make the user’s original question\\nclearer and more suitable for the retrieval task. Common\\nmethods include query rewriting query transformation, query\\nexpansion and other techniques [7], [9]–[11].\\nPost-Retrieval Process . Once relevant context is retrieved,\\nit’s crucial to integrate it effectively with the query. The main\\nmethods in post-retrieval process include rerank chunks and\\ncontext compressing. Re-ranking the retrieved information to\\nrelocate the most relevant content to the edges of the prompt is\\na key strategy. This concept has been implemented in frame-\\nworks such as LlamaIndex2, LangChain3, and HayStack [12].\\nFeeding all relevant documents directly into LLMs can lead\\nto information overload, diluting the focus on key details with\\nirrelevant content.To mitigate this, post-retrieval efforts con-\\ncentrate on selecting the essential information, emphasizing\\ncritical sections, and shortening the context to be processed.\\n2https://www.llamaindex.ai\\n3https://www.langchain.com/C. Modular RAG\\nThe modular RAG architecture advances beyond the for-\\nmer two RAG paradigms, offering enhanced adaptability and\\nversatility. It incorporates diverse strategies for improving its\\ncomponents, such as adding a search module for similarity\\nsearches and refining the retriever through fine-tuning.

Routing in the RAG system\\nnavigates through diverse data sources, selecting the optimal\\npathway for a query, whether it involves summarization,\\nspecific database searches, or merging different information\\nstreams [19]. The Predict module aims to reduce redundancy\\nand noise by generating context directly through the LLM,\\nensuring relevance and accuracy [13]. Lastly, the Task Adapter\\nmodule tailors RAG to various downstream tasks, automating\\nprompt retrieval for zero-shot inputs and creating task-specific\\nretrievers through few-shot query generation [20], [21] .This\\ncomprehensive approach not only streamlines the retrieval pro-\\ncess but also significantly improves the quality and relevance\\nof the information retrieved, catering to a wide array of tasks\\nand queries with enhanced precision and flexibility.\\n2) New Patterns: Modular RAG offers remarkable adapt-\\nability by allowing module substitution or reconfiguration\\nto address specific challenges. This goes beyond the fixed\\nstructures of Naive and Advanced RAG, characterized by a\\nsimple “Retrieve” and “Read” mechanism. Moreover, Modular\\nRAG expands this flexibility by integrating new modules or\\nadjusting interaction flow among existing ones, enhancing its\\napplicability across different tasks.\\nInnovations such as the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read [7]model\\nleverage the LLM’s capabilities to refine retrieval queries\\nthrough a rewriting module and a LM-feedback mechanism\\nto update rewriting model., improving task performance.\\nSimilarly, approaches like Generate-Read [13] replace tradi-\\ntional retrieval with LLM-generated content, while Recite-\\nRead [22] emphasizes retrieval from model weights, enhanc-\\ning the model’s ability to handle knowledge-intensive tasks.\\nHybrid retrieval strategies integrate keyword, semantic, and\\nvector searches to cater to diverse queries. Additionally, em-\\nploying sub-queries and hypothetical document embeddings\\n(HyDE) [11] seeks to improve retrieval relevance by focusing\\non embedding similarities between generated answers and real\\ndocuments.\\nAdjustments in module arrangement and interaction, such\\nas the Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) [23] framework\\nand the iterative Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read flow of ITER-\\nRETGEN [14], showcase the dynamic use of module out-\\nputs to bolster another module’s functionality, illustrating a\\nsophisticated understanding of enhancing module synergy.\\nThe flexible orchestration of Modular RAG Flow showcases\\nthe benefits of adaptive retrieval through techniques such as\\nFLARE [24] and Self-RAG [25]. This approach transcends\\nthe fixed RAG retrieval process by evaluating the necessity\\nof retrieval based on different scenarios. Another benefit of\\na flexible architecture is that the RAG system can more\\neasily integrate with other technologies (such as fine-tuning\\nor reinforcement learning) [26]. For example, this can involve\\nfine-tuning the retriever for better retrieval results, fine-tuning\\nthe generator for more personalized outputs, or engaging in\\ncollaborative fine-tuning [27].\\nD. RAG vs Fine-tuning\\nThe augmentation of LLMs has attracted considerable atten-\\ntion due to their growing prevalence. Among the optimizationmethods for LLMs, RAG is often compared with Fine-tuning\\n(FT) and prompt engineering. Each method has distinct charac-\\nteristics as illustrated in Figure 4. We used a quadrant chart to\\nillustrate the differences among three methods in two dimen-\\nsions: external knowledge requirements and model adaption\\nrequirements. Prompt engineering leverages a model’s inherent\\ncapabilities with minimum necessity for external knowledge\\nand model adaption. RAG can be likened to providing a model\\nwith a tailored textbook for information retrieval, ideal for pre-\\ncise information retrieval tasks. In contrast, FT is comparable\\nto a student internalizing knowledge over time, suitable for\\nscenarios requiring replication of specific structures, styles, or\\nformats.\\nRAG excels in dynamic environments by offering real-\\ntime knowledge updates and effective utilization of external\\nknowledge sources with high interpretability. However, it\\ncomes with higher latency and ethical considerations regarding\\ndata retrieval. On the other hand, FT is more static, requiring\\nretraining for updates but enabling deep customization of the\\nmodel’s behavior and style. It demands significant compu-\\ntational resources for dataset preparation and training, and\\nwhile it can reduce hallucinations, it may face challenges with\\nunfamiliar data.\\nIn multiple evaluations of their performance on various\\nknowledge-intensive tasks across different topics, [28] re-\\nvealed that while unsupervised fine-tuning shows some im-\\nprovement, RAG consistently outperforms it, for both exist-\\ning knowledge encountered during training and entirely new\\nknowledge. Additionally, it was found that LLMs struggle\\nto learn new factual information through unsupervised fine-\\ntuning. The choice between RAG and FT depends on the\\nspecific needs for data dynamics, customization, and com-\\nputational capabilities in the application context. RAG and\\nFT are not mutually exclusive and can complement each\\nother, enhancing a model’s capabilities at different levels.\\nIn some instances, their combined use may lead to optimal\\nperformance. The optimization process involving RAG and FT\\nmay require multiple iterations to achieve satisfactory results.\\nIII. R ETRIEVAL\\nIn the context of RAG, it is crucial to efficiently retrieve\\nrelevant documents from the data source. There are several\\nkey issues involved, such as the retrieval source, retrieval\\ngranularity, pre-processing of the retrieval, and selection of\\nthe corresponding embedding model.\\nA. Retrieval Source\\nRAG relies on external knowledge to enhance LLMs, while\\nthe type of retrieval source and the granularity of retrieval\\nunits both affect the final generation results.\\n1) Data Structure: Initially, text is s the mainstream source\\nof retrieval. Subsequently, the retrieval source expanded to in-\\nclude semi-structured data (PDF) and structured data (Knowl-\\nedge Graph, KG) for enhancement.

RAG compared with other model optimization methods in the aspects of “External Knowledge Required” and “Model Adaption Required”. Prompt\\nEngineering requires low modifications to the model and external knowledge, focusing on harnessing the capabilities of LLMs themselves. Fine-tuning, on\\nthe other hand, involves further training the model. In the early stages of RAG (Naive RAG), there is a low demand for model modifications. As research\\nprogresses, Modular RAG has become more integrated with fine-tuning techniques.\\nUnstructured Data , such as text, is the most widely used\\nretrieval source, which are mainly gathered from corpus. For\\nopen-domain question-answering (ODQA) tasks, the primary\\nretrieval sources are Wikipedia Dump with the current major\\nversions including HotpotQA4(1st October , 2017), DPR5(20\\nDecember, 2018). In addition to encyclopedic data, common\\nunstructured data includes cross-lingual text [19] and domain-\\nspecific data (such as medical [67]and legal domains [29]).\\nSemi-structured data . typically refers to data that contains a\\ncombination of text and table information, such as PDF. Han-\\ndling semi-structured data poses challenges for conventional\\nRAG systems due to two main reasons. Firstly, text splitting\\nprocesses may inadvertently separate tables, leading to data\\ncorruption during retrieval. Secondly, incorporating tables into\\nthe data can complicate semantic similarity searches. When\\ndealing with semi-structured data, one approach involves lever-\\naging the code capabilities of LLMs to execute Text-2-SQL\\nqueries on tables within databases, such as TableGPT [85].\\nAlternatively, tables can be transformed into text format for\\nfurther analysis using text-based methods [75]. However, both\\nof these methods are not optimal solutions, indicating substan-\\ntial research opportunities in this area.\\nStructured data , such as knowledge graphs (KGs) [86] ,\\nwhich are typically verified and can provide more precise in-\\nformation. KnowledGPT [15] generates KB search queries and\\nstores knowledge in a personalized base, enhancing the RAG\\nmodel’s knowledge richness. In response to the limitations of\\nLLMs in understanding and answering questions about textual\\ngraphs, G-Retriever [84] integrates Graph Neural Networks\\n4https://hotpotqa.github.io/wiki-readme.html\\n5https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR(GNNs), LLMs and RAG, enhancing graph comprehension\\nand question-answering capabilities through soft prompting\\nof the LLM, and employs the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree\\n(PCST) optimization problem for targeted graph retrieval. On\\nthe contrary, it requires additional effort to build, validate,\\nand maintain structured databases. On the contrary, it requires\\nadditional effort to build, validate, and maintain structured\\ndatabases.\\nLLMs-Generated Content. Addressing the limitations of\\nexternal auxiliary information in RAG, some research has\\nfocused on exploiting LLMs’ internal knowledge. SKR [58]\\nclassifies questions as known or unknown, applying retrieval\\nenhancement selectively. GenRead [13] replaces the retriever\\nwith an LLM generator, finding that LLM-generated contexts\\noften contain more accurate answers due to better alignment\\nwith the pre-training objectives of causal language modeling.\\nSelfmem [17] iteratively creates an unbounded memory pool\\nwith a retrieval-enhanced generator, using a memory selec-\\ntor to choose outputs that serve as dual problems to the\\noriginal question, thus self-enhancing the generative model.\\nThese methodologies underscore the breadth of innovative\\ndata source utilization in RAG, striving to improve model\\nperformance and task effectiveness.\\n2) Retrieval Granularity: Another important factor besides\\nthe data format of the retrieval source is the granularity of\\nthe retrieved data. Coarse-grained retrieval units theoretically\\ncan provide more relevant information for the problem, but\\nthey may also contain redundant content, which could distract\\nthe retriever and language models in downstream tasks [50],\\n[87]. On the other hand, fine-grained retrieval unit granularity\\nincreases the burden of retrieval and does not guarantee seman-\\ntic integrity and meeting the required knowledge. Choosing'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf_sources/pdf_data_source2.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='8\\nthe appropriate retrieval granularity during inference can be\\na simple and effective strategy to improve the retrieval and\\ndownstream task performance of dense retrievers.\\nIn text, retrieval granularity ranges from fine to coarse,\\nincluding Token, Phrase, Sentence, Proposition, Chunks, Doc-\\nument. Among them, DenseX [30]proposed the concept of\\nusing propositions as retrieval units. Propositions are defined\\nas atomic expressions in the text, each encapsulating a unique\\nfactual segment and presented in a concise, self-contained nat-\\nural language format. This approach aims to enhance retrieval\\nprecision and relevance. On the Knowledge Graph (KG),\\nretrieval granularity includes Entity, Triplet, and sub-Graph.\\nThe granularity of retrieval can also be adapted to downstream\\ntasks, such as retrieving Item IDs [40]in recommendation tasks\\nand Sentence pairs [38]. Detailed information is illustrated in\\nTable I.\\nB. Indexing Optimization\\nIn the Indexing phase, documents will be processed, seg-\\nmented, and transformed into Embeddings to be stored in a\\nvector database. The quality of index construction determines\\nwhether the correct context can be obtained in the retrieval\\nphase.\\n1) Chunking Strategy: The most common method is to split\\nthe document into chunks on a fixed number of tokens (e.g.,\\n100, 256, 512) [88]. Larger chunks can capture more context,\\nbut they also generate more noise, requiring longer processing\\ntime and higher costs. While smaller chunks may not fully\\nconvey the necessary context, they do have less noise. How-\\never, chunks leads to truncation within sentences, prompting\\nthe optimization of a recursive splits and sliding window meth-\\nods, enabling layered retrieval by merging globally related\\ninformation across multiple retrieval processes [89]. Never-\\ntheless, these approaches still cannot strike a balance between\\nsemantic completeness and context length. Therefore, methods\\nlike Small2Big have been proposed, where sentences (small)\\nare used as the retrieval unit, and the preceding and following\\nsentences are provided as (big) context to LLMs [90].\\n2) Metadata Attachments: Chunks can be enriched with\\nmetadata information such as page number, file name, au-\\nthor,category timestamp. Subsequently, retrieval can be filtered\\nbased on this metadata, limiting the scope of the retrieval.\\nAssigning different weights to document timestamps during\\nretrieval can achieve time-aware RAG, ensuring the freshness\\nof knowledge and avoiding outdated information.\\nIn addition to extracting metadata from the original doc-\\numents, metadata can also be artificially constructed. For\\nexample, adding summaries of paragraph, as well as intro-\\nducing hypothetical questions. This method is also known as\\nReverse HyDE. Specifically, using LLM to generate questions\\nthat can be answered by the document, then calculating the\\nsimilarity between the original question and the hypothetical\\nquestion during retrieval to reduce the semantic gap between\\nthe question and the answer.\\n3) Structural Index: One effective method for enhancing\\ninformation retrieval is to establish a hierarchical structure for\\nthe documents. By constructing In structure, RAG system can\\nexpedite the retrieval and processing of pertinent data.Hierarchical index structure . File are arranged in parent-\\nchild relationships, with chunks linked to them. Data sum-\\nmaries are stored at each node, aiding in the swift traversal\\nof data and assisting the RAG system in determining which\\nchunks to extract. This approach can also mitigate the illusion\\ncaused by block extraction issues.\\nKnowledge Graph index . Utilize KG in constructing the\\nhierarchical structure of documents contributes to maintaining\\nconsistency. It delineates the connections between different\\nconcepts and entities, markedly reducing the potential for\\nillusions. Another advantage is the transformation of the\\ninformation retrieval process into instructions that LLM can\\ncomprehend, thereby enhancing the accuracy of knowledge\\nretrieval and enabling LLM to generate contextually coherent\\nresponses, thus improving the overall efficiency of the RAG\\nsystem. To capture the logical relationship between document\\ncontent and structure, KGP [91] proposed a method of building\\nan index between multiple documents using KG. This KG\\nconsists of nodes (representing paragraphs or structures in the\\ndocuments, such as pages and tables) and edges (indicating\\nsemantic/lexical similarity between paragraphs or relationships\\nwithin the document structure), effectively addressing knowl-\\nedge retrieval and reasoning problems in a multi-document\\nenvironment.\\nC. Query Optimization\\nOne of the primary challenges with Naive RAG is its\\ndirect reliance on the user’s original query as the basis for\\nretrieval. Formulating a precise and clear question is difficult,\\nand imprudent queries result in subpar retrieval effectiveness.\\nSometimes, the question itself is complex, and the language\\nis not well-organized. Another difficulty lies in language\\ncomplexity ambiguity. Language models often struggle when\\ndealing with specialized vocabulary or ambiguous abbrevi-\\nations with multiple meanings. For instance, they may not\\ndiscern whether “LLM” refers to large language model or a\\nMaster of Laws in a legal context.\\n1) Query Expansion: Expanding a single query into mul-\\ntiple queries enriches the content of the query, providing\\nfurther context to address any lack of specific nuances, thereby\\nensuring the optimal relevance of the generated answers.\\nMulti-Query . By employing prompt engineering to expand\\nqueries via LLMs, these queries can then be executed in\\nparallel. The expansion of queries is not random, but rather\\nmeticulously designed.\\nSub-Query . The process of sub-question planning represents\\nthe generation of the necessary sub-questions to contextualize\\nand fully answer the original question when combined. This\\nprocess of adding relevant context is, in principle, similar\\nto query expansion. Specifically, a complex question can be\\ndecomposed into a series of simpler sub-questions using the\\nleast-to-most prompting method [92].\\nChain-of-Verification(CoVe) . The expanded queries undergo\\nvalidation by LLM to achieve the effect of reducing halluci-\\nnations. Validated expanded queries typically exhibit higher\\nreliability [93].'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf_sources/pdf_data_source2.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='9\\n2) Query Transformation: The core concept is to retrieve\\nchunks based on a transformed query instead of the user’s\\noriginal query.\\nQuery Rewrite .The original queries are not always optimal\\nfor LLM retrieval, especially in real-world scenarios. There-\\nfore, we can prompt LLM to rewrite the queries. In addition to\\nusing LLM for query rewriting, specialized smaller language\\nmodels, such as RRR (Rewrite-retrieve-read) [7]. The imple-\\nmentation of the query rewrite method in the Taobao, known\\nas BEQUE [9] has notably enhanced recall effectiveness for\\nlong-tail queries, resulting in a rise in GMV .\\nAnother query transformation method is to use prompt\\nengineering to let LLM generate a query based on the original\\nquery for subsequent retrieval. HyDE [11] construct hypothet-\\nical documents (assumed answers to the original query). It\\nfocuses on embedding similarity from answer to answer rather\\nthan seeking embedding similarity for the problem or query.\\nUsing the Step-back Prompting method [10], the original\\nquery is abstracted to generate a high-level concept question\\n(step-back question). In the RAG system, both the step-back\\nquestion and the original query are used for retrieval, and both\\nthe results are utilized as the basis for language model answer\\ngeneration.\\n3) Query Routing: Based on varying queries, routing to\\ndistinct RAG pipeline,which is suitable for a versatile RAG\\nsystem designed to accommodate diverse scenarios.\\nMetadata Router/ Filter . The first step involves extracting\\nkeywords (entity) from the query, followed by filtering based\\non the keywords and metadata within the chunks to narrow\\ndown the search scope.\\nSemantic Router is another method of routing involves\\nleveraging the semantic information of the query. Specific\\napprach see Semantic Router6. Certainly, a hybrid routing\\napproach can also be employed, combining both semantic and\\nmetadata-based methods for enhanced query routing.\\nD. Embedding\\nIn RAG, retrieval is achieved by calculating the similarity\\n(e.g. cosine similarity) between the embeddings of the ques-\\ntion and document chunks, where the semantic representation\\ncapability of embedding models plays a key role. This mainly\\nincludes a sparse encoder (BM25) and a dense retriever (BERT\\narchitecture Pre-training language models). Recent research\\nhas introduced prominent embedding models such as AngIE,\\nV oyage, BGE,etc [94]–[96], which are benefit from multi-task\\ninstruct tuning. Hugging Face’s MTEB leaderboard7evaluates\\nembedding models across 8 tasks, covering 58 datasests. Ad-\\nditionally, C-MTEB focuses on Chinese capability, covering\\n6 tasks and 35 datasets. There is no one-size-fits-all answer\\nto “which embedding model to use.” However, some specific\\nmodels are better suited for particular use cases.\\n1) Mix/hybrid Retrieval : Sparse and dense embedding\\napproaches capture different relevance features and can ben-\\nefit from each other by leveraging complementary relevance\\ninformation. For instance, sparse retrieval models can be used\\n6https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router\\n7https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboardto provide initial search results for training dense retrieval\\nmodels. Additionally, pre-training language models (PLMs)\\ncan be utilized to learn term weights to enhance sparse\\nretrieval. Specifically, it also demonstrates that sparse retrieval\\nmodels can enhance the zero-shot retrieval capability of dense\\nretrieval models and assist dense retrievers in handling queries\\ncontaining rare entities, thereby improving robustness.\\n2) Fine-tuning Embedding Model: In instances where the\\ncontext significantly deviates from pre-training corpus, partic-\\nularly within highly specialized disciplines such as healthcare,\\nlegal practice, and other sectors replete with proprietary jargon,\\nfine-tuning the embedding model on your own domain dataset\\nbecomes essential to mitigate such discrepancies.\\nIn addition to supplementing domain knowledge, another\\npurpose of fine-tuning is to align the retriever and generator,\\nfor example, using the results of LLM as the supervision signal\\nfor fine-tuning, known as LSR (LM-supervised Retriever).\\nPROMPTAGATOR [21] utilizes the LLM as a few-shot query\\ngenerator to create task-specific retrievers, addressing chal-\\nlenges in supervised fine-tuning, particularly in data-scarce\\ndomains. Another approach, LLM-Embedder [97], exploits\\nLLMs to generate reward signals across multiple downstream\\ntasks. The retriever is fine-tuned with two types of supervised\\nsignals: hard labels for the dataset and soft rewards from\\nthe LLMs. This dual-signal approach fosters a more effective\\nfine-tuning process, tailoring the embedding model to diverse\\ndownstream applications. REPLUG [72] utilizes a retriever\\nand an LLM to calculate the probability distributions of the\\nretrieved documents and then performs supervised training\\nby computing the KL divergence. This straightforward and\\neffective training method enhances the performance of the\\nretrieval model by using an LM as the supervisory signal,\\neliminating the need for specific cross-attention mechanisms.\\nMoreover, inspired by RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from\\nHuman Feedback), utilizing LM-based feedback to reinforce\\nthe retriever through reinforcement learning.\\nE. Adapter\\nFine-tuning models may present challenges, such as in-\\ntegrating functionality through an API or addressing con-\\nstraints arising from limited local computational resources.\\nConsequently, some approaches opt to incorporate an external\\nadapter to aid in alignment.\\nTo optimize the multi-task capabilities of LLM, UP-\\nRISE [20] trained a lightweight prompt retriever that can\\nautomatically retrieve prompts from a pre-built prompt pool\\nthat are suitable for a given zero-shot task input. AAR\\n(Augmentation-Adapted Retriver) [47] introduces a universal\\nadapter designed to accommodate multiple downstream tasks.\\nWhile PRCA [69] add a pluggable reward-driven contextual\\nadapter to enhance performance on specific tasks. BGM [26]\\nkeeps the retriever and LLM fixed,and trains a bridge Seq2Seq\\nmodel in between. The bridge model aims to transform the\\nretrieved information into a format that LLMs can work with\\neffectively, allowing it to not only rerank but also dynami-\\ncally select passages for each query, and potentially employ\\nmore advanced strategies like repetition. Furthermore, PKG'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf_sources/pdf_data_source2.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='10\\nintroduces an innovative method for integrating knowledge\\ninto white-box models via directive fine-tuning [75]. In this\\napproach, the retriever module is directly substituted to gen-\\nerate relevant documents according to a query. This method\\nassists in addressing the difficulties encountered during the\\nfine-tuning process and enhances model performance.\\nIV. G ENERATION\\nAfter retrieval, it is not a good practice to directly input all\\nthe retrieved information to the LLM for answering questions.\\nFollowing will introduce adjustments from two perspectives:\\nadjusting the retrieved content and adjusting the LLM.\\nA. Context Curation\\nRedundant information can interfere with the final gener-\\nation of LLM, and overly long contexts can also lead LLM\\nto the “Lost in the middle” problem [98]. Like humans, LLM\\ntends to only focus on the beginning and end of long texts,\\nwhile forgetting the middle portion. Therefore, in the RAG\\nsystem, we typically need to further process the retrieved\\ncontent.\\n1) Reranking: Reranking fundamentally reorders document\\nchunks to highlight the most pertinent results first, effectively\\nreducing the overall document pool, severing a dual purpose\\nin information retrieval, acting as both an enhancer and a\\nfilter, delivering refined inputs for more precise language\\nmodel processing [70]. Reranking can be performed using\\nrule-based methods that depend on predefined metrics like\\nDiversity, Relevance, and MRR, or model-based approaches\\nlike Encoder-Decoder models from the BERT series (e.g.,\\nSpanBERT), specialized reranking models such as Cohere\\nrerank or bge-raranker-large, and general large language mod-\\nels like GPT [12], [99].\\n2) Context Selection/Compression: A common misconcep-\\ntion in the RAG process is the belief that retrieving as many\\nrelevant documents as possible and concatenating them to form\\na lengthy retrieval prompt is beneficial. However, excessive\\ncontext can introduce more noise, diminishing the LLM’s\\nperception of key information .\\n(Long) LLMLingua [100], [101] utilize small language\\nmodels (SLMs) such as GPT-2 Small or LLaMA-7B, to\\ndetect and remove unimportant tokens, transforming it into\\na form that is challenging for humans to comprehend but\\nwell understood by LLMs. This approach presents a direct\\nand practical method for prompt compression, eliminating the\\nneed for additional training of LLMs while balancing language\\nintegrity and compression ratio. PRCA tackled this issue by\\ntraining an information extractor [69]. Similarly, RECOMP\\nadopts a comparable approach by training an information\\ncondenser using contrastive learning [71]. Each training data\\npoint consists of one positive sample and five negative sam-\\nples, and the encoder undergoes training using contrastive loss\\nthroughout this process [102] .\\nIn addition to compressing the context, reducing the num-\\nber of documents aslo helps improve the accuracy of the\\nmodel’s answers. Ma et al. [103] propose the “Filter-Reranker”\\nparadigm, which combines the strengths of LLMs and SLMs.In this paradigm, SLMs serve as filters, while LLMs function\\nas reordering agents. The research shows that instructing\\nLLMs to rearrange challenging samples identified by SLMs\\nleads to significant improvements in various Information\\nExtraction (IE) tasks. Another straightforward and effective\\napproach involves having the LLM evaluate the retrieved\\ncontent before generating the final answer. This allows the\\nLLM to filter out documents with poor relevance through LLM\\ncritique. For instance, in Chatlaw [104], the LLM is prompted\\nto self-suggestion on the referenced legal provisions to assess\\ntheir relevance.\\nB. LLM Fine-tuning\\nTargeted fine-tuning based on the scenario and data char-\\nacteristics on LLMs can yield better results. This is also one\\nof the greatest advantages of using on-premise LLMs. When\\nLLMs lack data in a specific domain, additional knowledge can\\nbe provided to the LLM through fine-tuning. Huggingface’s\\nfine-tuning data can also be used as an initial step.\\nAnother benefit of fine-tuning is the ability to adjust the\\nmodel’s input and output. For example, it can enable LLM to\\nadapt to specific data formats and generate responses in a par-\\nticular style as instructed [37]. For retrieval tasks that engage\\nwith structured data, the SANTA framework [76] implements\\na tripartite training regimen to effectively encapsulate both\\nstructural and semantic nuances. The initial phase focuses on\\nthe retriever, where contrastive learning is harnessed to refine\\nthe query and document embeddings.\\nAligning LLM outputs with human or retriever preferences\\nthrough reinforcement learning is a potential approach. For\\ninstance, manually annotating the final generated answers\\nand then providing feedback through reinforcement learning.\\nIn addition to aligning with human preferences, it is also\\npossible to align with the preferences of fine-tuned models\\nand retrievers [79]. When circumstances prevent access to\\npowerful proprietary models or larger parameter open-source\\nmodels, a simple and effective method is to distill the more\\npowerful models(e.g. GPT-4). Fine-tuning of LLM can also\\nbe coordinated with fine-tuning of the retriever to align pref-\\nerences. A typical approach, such as RA-DIT [27], aligns the\\nscoring functions between Retriever and Generator using KL\\ndivergence.\\nV. A UGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG\\nIn the domain of RAG, the standard practice often involves\\na singular (once) retrieval step followed by generation, which\\ncan lead to inefficiencies and sometimes is typically insuffi-\\ncient for complex problems demanding multi-step reasoning,\\nas it provides a limited scope of information [105]. Many\\nstudies have optimized the retrieval process in response to this\\nissue, and we have summarised them in Figure 5.\\nA. Iterative Retrieval\\nIterative retrieval is a process where the knowledge base\\nis repeatedly searched based on the initial query and the text\\ngenerated so far, providing a more comprehensive knowledge'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf_sources/pdf_data_source2.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='11\\nFig. 5. In addition to the most common once retrieval, RAG also includes three types of retrieval augmentation processes. (left) Iterative retrieval involves\\nalternating between retrieval and generation, allowing for richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base at each step. (Middle) Recursive retrieval\\ninvolves gradually refining the user query and breaking down the problem into sub-problems, then continuously solving complex problems through retrieval\\nand generation. (Right) Adaptive retrieval focuses on enabling the RAG system to autonomously determine whether external knowledge retrieval is necessary\\nand when to stop retrieval and generation, often utilizing LLM-generated special tokens for control.\\nbase for LLMs. This approach has been shown to enhance\\nthe robustness of subsequent answer generation by offering\\nadditional contextual references through multiple retrieval\\niterations. However, it may be affected by semantic discon-\\ntinuity and the accumulation of irrelevant information. ITER-\\nRETGEN [14] employs a synergistic approach that lever-\\nages “retrieval-enhanced generation” alongside “generation-\\nenhanced retrieval” for tasks that necessitate the reproduction\\nof specific information. The model harnesses the content\\nrequired to address the input task as a contextual basis for\\nretrieving pertinent knowledge, which in turn facilitates the\\ngeneration of improved responses in subsequent iterations.\\nB. Recursive Retrieval\\nRecursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and\\nNLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results.\\nThe process involves iteratively refining search queries based\\non the results obtained from previous searches. Recursive\\nRetrieval aims to enhance the search experience by gradu-\\nally converging on the most pertinent information through a\\nfeedback loop. IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide\\nthe retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained\\nretrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that\\nsystematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query. It\\ncan be particularly useful in complex search scenarios where\\nthe user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where\\nthe information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The\\nrecursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning\\nand adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in\\nimproved satisfaction with the search outcomes.\\nTo address specific data scenarios, recursive retrieval and\\nmulti-hop retrieval techniques are utilized together. Recursiveretrieval involves a structured index to process and retrieve\\ndata in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing\\nsections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a\\nretrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary\\nretrieval within the document refines the search, embodying\\nthe recursive nature of the process. In contrast, multi-hop\\nretrieval is designed to delve deeper into graph-structured data\\nsources, extracting interconnected information [106].\\nC. Adaptive Retrieval\\nAdaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare [24] and\\nSelf-RAG [25], refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs\\nto actively determine the optimal moments and content for\\nretrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the\\ninformation sourced.\\nThese methods are part of a broader trend wherein\\nLLMs employ active judgment in their operations, as seen\\nin model agents like AutoGPT, Toolformer, and Graph-\\nToolformer [107]–[109]. Graph-Toolformer, for instance, di-\\nvides its retrieval process into distinct steps where LLMs\\nproactively use retrievers, apply Self-Ask techniques, and em-\\nploy few-shot prompts to initiate search queries. This proactive\\nstance allows LLMs to decide when to search for necessary\\ninformation, akin to how an agent utilizes tools.\\nWebGPT [110] integrates a reinforcement learning frame-\\nwork to train the GPT-3 model in autonomously using a\\nsearch engine during text generation. It navigates this process\\nusing special tokens that facilitate actions such as search\\nengine queries, browsing results, and citing references, thereby\\nexpanding GPT-3’s capabilities through the use of external\\nsearch engines. Flare automates timing retrieval by monitoring\\nthe confidence of the generation process, as indicated by the'),\n",

When the probability falls\\nbelow a certain threshold would activates the retrieval system\\nto collect relevant information, thus optimizing the retrieval\\ncycle. Self-RAG [25] introduces “reflection tokens” that allow\\nthe model to introspect its outputs. These tokens come in\\ntwo varieties: “retrieve” and “critic”. The model autonomously\\ndecides when to activate retrieval, or alternatively, a predefined\\nthreshold may trigger the process. During retrieval, the gen-\\nerator conducts a fragment-level beam search across multiple\\nparagraphs to derive the most coherent sequence. Critic scores\\nare used to update the subdivision scores, with the flexibility\\nto adjust these weights during inference, tailoring the model’s\\nbehavior. Self-RAG’s design obviates the need for additional\\nclassifiers or reliance on Natural Language Inference (NLI)\\nmodels, thus streamlining the decision-making process for\\nwhen to engage retrieval mechanisms and improving the\\nmodel’s autonomous judgment capabilities in generating ac-\\ncurate responses.\\nVI. T ASK AND EVALUATION\\nThe rapid advancement and growing adoption of RAG\\nin the field of NLP have propelled the evaluation of RAG\\nmodels to the forefront of research in the LLMs community.\\nThe primary objective of this evaluation is to comprehend\\nand optimize the performance of RAG models across diverse\\napplication scenarios.This chapter will mainly introduce the\\nmain downstream tasks of RAG, datasets, and how to evaluate\\nRAG systems.\\nA. Downstream Task\\nThe core task of RAG remains Question Answering (QA),\\nincluding traditional single-hop/multi-hop QA, multiple-\\nchoice, domain-specific QA as well as long-form scenarios\\nsuitable for RAG. In addition to QA, RAG is continuously\\nbeing expanded into multiple downstream tasks, such as Infor-\\nmation Extraction (IE), dialogue generation, code search, etc.\\nThe main downstream tasks of RAG and their corresponding\\ndatasets are summarized in Table II.\\nB. Evaluation Target\\nHistorically, RAG models assessments have centered on\\ntheir execution in specific downstream tasks. These evaluations\\nemploy established metrics suitable to the tasks at hand. For\\ninstance, question answering evaluations might rely on EM\\nand F1 scores [7], [45], [59], [72], whereas fact-checking\\ntasks often hinge on Accuracy as the primary metric [4],\\n[14], [42]. BLEU and ROUGE metrics are also commonly\\nused to evaluate answer quality [26], [32], [52], [78]. Tools\\nlike RALLE, designed for the automatic evaluation of RAG\\napplications, similarly base their assessments on these task-\\nspecific metrics [160]. Despite this, there is a notable paucity\\nof research dedicated to evaluating the distinct characteristics\\nof RAG models.The main evaluation objectives include:\\nRetrieval Quality . Evaluating the retrieval quality is crucial\\nfor determining the effectiveness of the context sourced by\\nthe retriever component. Standard metrics from the domainsof search engines, recommendation systems, and information\\nretrieval systems are employed to measure the performance of\\nthe RAG retrieval module. Metrics such as Hit Rate, MRR, and\\nNDCG are commonly utilized for this purpose [161], [162].\\nGeneration Quality . The assessment of generation quality\\ncenters on the generator’s capacity to synthesize coherent and\\nrelevant answers from the retrieved context. This evaluation\\ncan be categorized based on the content’s objectives: unlabeled\\nand labeled content. For unlabeled content, the evaluation\\nencompasses the faithfulness, relevance, and non-harmfulness\\nof the generated answers. In contrast, for labeled content,\\nthe focus is on the accuracy of the information produced by\\nthe model [161]. Additionally, both retrieval and generation\\nquality assessments can be conducted through manual or\\nautomatic evaluation methods [29], [161], [163].\\nC. Evaluation Aspects\\nContemporary evaluation practices of RAG models empha-\\nsize three primary quality scores and four essential abilities,\\nwhich collectively inform the evaluation of the two principal\\ntargets of the RAG model: retrieval and generation.\\n1) Quality Scores: Quality scores include context rele-\\nvance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. These qual-\\nity scores evaluate the efficiency of the RAG model from\\ndifferent perspectives in the process of information retrieval\\nand generation [164]–[166].\\nContext Relevance evaluates the precision and specificity\\nof the retrieved context, ensuring relevance and minimizing\\nprocessing costs associated with extraneous content.\\nAnswer Faithfulness ensures that the generated answers\\nremain true to the retrieved context, maintaining consistency\\nand avoiding contradictions.\\nAnswer Relevance requires that the generated answers are\\ndirectly pertinent to the posed questions, effectively addressing\\nthe core inquiry.\\n2) Required Abilities: RAG evaluation also encompasses\\nfour abilities indicative of its adaptability and efficiency:\\nnoise robustness, negative rejection, information integration,\\nand counterfactual robustness [167], [168]. These abilities are\\ncritical for the model’s performance under various challenges\\nand complex scenarios, impacting the quality scores.\\nNoise Robustness appraises the model’s capability to man-\\nage noise documents that are question-related but lack sub-\\nstantive information.\\nNegative Rejection assesses the model’s discernment in\\nrefraining from responding when the retrieved documents do\\nnot contain the necessary knowledge to answer a question.\\nInformation Integration evaluates the model’s proficiency in\\nsynthesizing information from multiple documents to address\\ncomplex questions.\\nCounterfactual Robustness tests the model’s ability to rec-\\nognize and disregard known inaccuracies within documents,\\neven when instructed about potential misinformation.\\nContext relevance and noise robustness are important for\\nevaluating the quality of retrieval, while answer faithfulness,\\nanswer relevance, negative rejection, information integration,\\nand counterfactual robustness are important for evaluating the\\nquality of generation.'),\n",

Custom metrics tailored\\nto the nuances of RAG models, though not included here, have\\nalso been developed in some evaluation studies.\\nD. Evaluation Benchmarks and Tools\\nA series of benchmark tests and tools have been proposed\\nto facilitate the evaluation of RAG.These instruments furnish\\nquantitative metrics that not only gauge RAG model perfor-\\nmance but also enhance comprehension of the model’s capabil-\\nities across various evaluation aspects. Prominent benchmarks\\nsuch as RGB, RECALL and CRUD [167]–[169] focus on\\nappraising the essential abilities of RAG models. Concur-\\nrently, state-of-the-art automated tools like RAGAS [164],\\nARES [165], and TruLens8employ LLMs to adjudicate the\\nquality scores. These tools and benchmarks collectively form\\na robust framework for the systematic evaluation of RAG\\nmodels, as summarized in Table IV.\\nVII. D ISCUSSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS\\nDespite the considerable progress in RAG technology, sev-\\neral challenges persist that warrant in-depth research.This\\nchapter will mainly introduce the current challenges and future\\nresearch directions faced by RAG.\\nA. RAG vs Long Context\\nWith the deepening of related research, the context of LLMs\\nis continuously expanding [170]–[172]. Presently, LLMs can\\neffortlessly manage contexts exceeding 200,000 tokens9. This\\ncapability signifies that long-document question answering,\\npreviously reliant on RAG, can now incorporate the entire\\ndocument directly into the prompt. This has also sparked\\ndiscussions on whether RAG is still necessary when LLMs\\n8https://www.trulens.org/trulens eval/core concepts ragtriad/\\n9https://kimi.moonshot.cnare not constrained by context. In fact, RAG still plays an\\nirreplaceable role. On one hand, providing LLMs with a\\nlarge amount of context at once will significantly impact its\\ninference speed, while chunked retrieval and on-demand input\\ncan significantly improve operational efficiency. On the other\\nhand, RAG-based generation can quickly locate the original\\nreferences for LLMs to help users verify the generated an-\\nswers. The entire retrieval and reasoning process is observable,\\nwhile generation solely relying on long context remains a\\nblack box. Conversely, the expansion of context provides new\\nopportunities for the development of RAG, enabling it to\\naddress more complex problems and integrative or summary\\nquestions that require reading a large amount of material to\\nanswer [49]. Developing new RAG methods in the context of\\nsuper-long contexts is one of the future research trends.\\nB. RAG Robustness\\nThe presence of noise or contradictory information during\\nretrieval can detrimentally affect RAG’s output quality. This\\nsituation is figuratively referred to as “Misinformation can\\nbe worse than no information at all”. Improving RAG’s\\nresistance to such adversarial or counterfactual inputs is gain-\\ning research momentum and has become a key performance\\nmetric [48], [50], [82]. Cuconasu et al. [54] analyze which\\ntype of documents should be retrieved, evaluate the relevance\\nof the documents to the prompt, their position, and the\\nnumber included in the context. The research findings reveal\\nthat including irrelevant documents can unexpectedly increase\\naccuracy by over 30%, contradicting the initial assumption\\nof reduced quality. These results underscore the importance\\nof developing specialized strategies to integrate retrieval with\\nlanguage generation models, highlighting the need for further\\nresearch and exploration into the robustness of RAG.\\nC. Hybrid Approaches\\nCombining RAG with fine-tuning is emerging as a leading\\nstrategy. Determining the optimal integration of RAG and\\nfine-tuning whether sequential, alternating, or through end-to-\\nend joint training—and how to harness both parameterized'),\n",

Readers are encouraged to consult pertinent literature for the specific quantification formulas associated with these\\nmetrics, as required.\\nand non-parameterized advantages are areas ripe for explo-\\nration [27]. Another trend is to introduce SLMs with specific\\nfunctionalities into RAG and fine-tuned by the results of RAG\\nsystem. For example, CRAG [67] trains a lightweight retrieval\\nevaluator to assess the overall quality of the retrieved docu-\\nments for a query and triggers different knowledge retrieval\\nactions based on confidence levels.\\nD. Scaling laws of RAG\\nEnd-to-end RAG models and pre-trained models based\\non RAG are still one of the focuses of current re-\\nsearchers [173].The parameters of these models are one of\\nthe key factors.While scaling laws [174] are established for\\nLLMs, their applicability to RAG remains uncertain. Initial\\nstudies like RETRO++ [44] have begun to address this, yet the\\nparameter count in RAG models still lags behind that of LLMs.\\nThe possibility of an Inverse Scaling Law10, where smaller\\nmodels outperform larger ones, is particularly intriguing and\\nmerits further investigation.\\nE. Production-Ready RAG\\nRAG’s practicality and alignment with engineering require-\\nments have facilitated its adoption. However, enhancing re-\\ntrieval efficiency, improving document recall in large knowl-\\nedge bases, and ensuring data security—such as preventing\\n10https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prizeinadvertent disclosure of document sources or metadata by\\nLLMs—are critical engineering challenges that remain to be\\naddressed [175].\\nThe development of the RAG ecosystem is greatly impacted\\nby the progression of its technical stack. Key tools like\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex have quickly gained popularity\\nwith the emergence of ChatGPT, providing extensive RAG-\\nrelated APIs and becoming essential in the realm of LLMs.The\\nemerging technology stack, while not as rich in features as\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex, stands out through its specialized\\nproducts. For example, Flowise AI prioritizes a low-code\\napproach, allowing users to deploy AI applications, including\\nRAG, through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. Other\\ntechnologies like HayStack, Meltano, and Cohere Coral are\\nalso gaining attention for their unique contributions to the field.\\nIn addition to AI-focused vendors, traditional software and\\ncloud service providers are expanding their offerings to include\\nRAG-centric services. Weaviate’s Verba11is designed for\\npersonal assistant applications, while Amazon’s Kendra12\\noffers intelligent enterprise search services, enabling users to\\nbrowse various content repositories using built-in connectors.\\nIn the development of RAG technology, there is a clear\\ntrend towards different specialization directions, such as: 1)\\nCustomization - tailoring RAG to meet specific requirements.\\n2) Simplification - making RAG easier to use to reduce the\\n11https://github.com/weaviate/Verba\\n12https://aws.amazon.com/cn/kendra/'),\n",

RAG toolkits are converging into a\\nfoundational technology stack, laying the groundwork for\\nadvanced enterprise applications. However, a fully integrated,\\ncomprehensive platform concept is still in the future, requiring\\nfurther innovation and development.\\nF . Multi-modal RAG\\nRAG has transcended its initial text-based question-\\nanswering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data.\\nThis expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models\\nthat integrate RAG concepts across various domains:\\nImage . RA-CM3 [176] stands as a pioneering multimodal\\nmodel of both retrieving and generating text and images.\\nBLIP-2 [177] leverages frozen image encoders alongside\\nLLMs for efficient visual language pre-training, enabling zero-\\nshot image-to-text conversions. The “Visualize Before You\\nWrite” method [178] employs image generation to steer the\\nLM’s text generation, showing promise in open-ended text\\ngeneration tasks.\\nAudio and Video . The GSS method retrieves and stitches\\ntogether audio clips to convert machine-translated data into\\nspeech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant ad-\\nvancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by\\nincorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text con-\\nversion [180]. Additionally, KNN-based attention fusion lever-\\nages audio embeddings and semantically related text embed-\\ndings to refine ASR, thereby accelerating domain adaptation.Vid2Seq augments language models with specialized temporal\\nmarkers, facilitating the prediction of event boundaries and\\ntextual descriptions within a unified output sequence [181].\\nCode . RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by\\nretrieving code examples that align with developers’ objectives\\nthrough encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has\\ndemonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion genera-\\ntion and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK\\nmethod [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query\\nfrom a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints\\nwithin the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph\\nquestion-answering tasks.\\nVIII. C ONCLUSION\\nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, empha-\\nsizes RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the capa-\\nbilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from\\nlanguage models with extensive non-parameterized data from\\nexternal knowledge bases. The survey showcases the evolution\\nof RAG technologies and their application on many different\\ntasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms\\nwithin the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modu-\\nlar RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over\\nits predecessors. RAG’s technical integration with other AI\\nmethodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,\\nhas further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in\\nRAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve\\nits robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts.\\nRAG’s application scope is expanding into multimodal do-\\nmains, adapting its principles to interpret and process diverse\\ndata forms like images, videos, and code. This expansion high-\\nlights RAG’s significant practical implications for AI deploy-\\nment, attracting interest from academic and industrial sectors.'),\n",

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows to easily attach and manipulate a\\nnon-parametric knowledgebases to LLMs. Applications of RAG in the field of medical education\\nare discussed in this paper. A combined extractive and abstractive summarization method for large\\nunstructured textual data using representative vectors is proposed.\\nKeywords AI for Medicine ·Representative Vectors\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are demonstrating amazing zero-shot learning capabilities. They have many applications\\nincluding content generation and general question answering. These models learn the data they were trained on very\\nwell and the knowledge is retained encoded in the model weights as a parameterized knowledgebase. This also makes it\\ndifficult to revise or update the knowledge of an LLM later, once it is trained on a large corpus of training data [ 1]. The\\nmodels can hallucinate, producing factually inaccurate, plausible-sounding answers. Retrieval Augmented Generation\\n(RAG) tries to mitigate these issues by attaching a non-parametric knowledgebase to the LLM, in the form of a vector\\ndatabase [ 2]. Knowledge in the vector database can easily be modified and different kinds of unstructured textual data\\ncan be vectorized and stored in a single vector database.\\nRAG-assisted summarization is an important aspect of document intelligence as well. It poses more challenges than\\nretrieval. A well-written summary should highlight the key points and provide an overview of the document’s topics.\\nGenerating summaries of large documents directly using LLMs is difficult because the input content is often too large\\nto fit into the model’s context window. Performance tends to decrease with increasing context lengths even in large\\ncontext window models. Furthermore, the ’Lost in the Middle’ problem, the phenomenon that the LLMs tend to ignore\\nfacts in the middle of the context and assign more importance to the beginning and the end of the context becomes\\nworse with large input contexts [3].\\nTo overcome these challenges, RAG-assisted Representative Vector Summarization (RVS) is introduced in this paper.\\nRVS selects a pre-defined number ( k) of representative text chunks from the non-parametric knowledgebase and applies\\na combined abstractive and extractive summarizing workflow to generate the final summary. The value of parameter k\\nis determined based on the maximum token limit that can be afforded. The model can identify keywords of the text\\nchunks and their relative importance and create visual representations of the overall content of the document using\\nword clouds and scatter plots.\\nRVS is implemented in docGPT , a document intelligence program written in Python using langchain framework and\\nthe source is available at https://github.com/ssm123ssm/docGPT-pharm [4].arXiv:2308.00479v1  [cs.CL]  1 Aug 2023'),\n",

The extracted text\\nis initially stored in memory as a Document and then the Document is split into text chunks using recursive character text\\nsplitting. The chunks are then embedded in a 1536-dimensional vector space using OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002\\nembedding engine and stored in Facebook AI Similarity Search ( FAISS ) vector database [ 3]. The FAISS vector database\\nis used to find the k-most similar chunks to a given query at the query time. The original query, combined with the\\nretrieved chunks is compiled into a prompt and passed to the LLM for generating the answer. The model workflow and\\nthe steps excecuted at build-time and at query-time are depicted in Figure 1.\\n2.2 Summarization\\n2.2.1 Representative Vector\\nA maximum affordable token limit ( T) is initially defined. The target is to select knumber of chunks which is the\\nmaximum number of chunks that can be selected without their total token size exceeding T, from the vector database of\\nnchunks. Assuming each chunk has an average token size of s,kis simply obtained by optimizing for max k≤n,k×s≤Tk\\nOnce kis calculated, the chunks in the high-dimension vector space are quantized using the k-means clustering\\nalgorithm. k-number of clusters which minimize the within-cluster sum of squared Euclidian distances from the\\ncorresponding centroids are created within the vector space. Since the distribution of chunks in the vector space is based\\non their contextual similarity, we assume each cluster captures different aspects/semantics of the original document.\\nAfter this quantization, one representative chunk, which is the closest to the corresponding centroid from each cluster is\\nextracted.\\nLet vectors be an n×dmatrix, where nis the number of chunks and dis the dimensionality of the embeddings. Let\\ncentroids [i]denote the centroid of i-th cluster. The Euclidian distance between the m-th data point and the centroid of\\nthei-th cluster is calculated by\\ndistance m=vuutdX\\nj=1(vectors [m][j]−centroids [i][j])2 (1)\\nand stored in the distances [i]array.\\nNext, the index of the data point that has the minimum distance to the centroid of the i-th cluster, denoted as\\nclosest _index i, is calculated by:\\nclosest _index i= argmin distances i (2)\\nFinally, the closest _index ivalues for all clusters are stored in a list.\\nclosest _indices = [closest _index 0, closest _index 1, . . . , closest _index k−1]\\nOnce the indices of the representative chunks are identified, they are stored in a separate representative Document list.\\n2.2.2 Keyword generation and mapping\\nEven though the token size of the representative text chunks obtained with this method is relatively smaller compared to\\nthe original document, it can still be too large to fit into the LLM’s context window. For example, docGPT uses a default\\nmaximum affordable token limit of 10,000 tokens. The default LLM that docGPT calls is OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo ,\\nwhich has a maximum context window of 4k. Therefore, the representative Document list undergoes an intermediate\\nstep of extractive summarization (keyword generation and mapping) for each chunk in it.\\nThree keywords are generated for each representative chunk and the keywords are distributed among all the other\\nmembers of the same cluster. A word cloud is generated from all the keywords from the n chunks. The relative\\nfrequency that each keyword appears is reflected by the size of the word in the word cloud.\\n2'),\n",

This enables\\nthe identification of the distribution of the contents of the entire document at a glance.\\nFinally, the mapped summaries are used to create a final abstractive summary and to create a list of key points from the\\ndocuments.\\n3 Evaluation\\n3.1 Retrieval\\nResponses for queries on clinical medicine and general pharmacology from LLM without a non-parametric knowledge-\\nbase and a RAG model with vector databases built from Kumar and Clark’s Clinical Medicine 10th Edition and British\\nNational Formulary 82 were compared and checked for accuracy [ 6,7].

The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms\\nwithin the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modu-\\nlar RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over\\nits predecessors. RAG’s technical integration with other AI\\nmethodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,\\nhas further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in\\nRAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve\\nits robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts.'),\n",

They have many applications\\nincluding content generation and general question answering. These models learn the data they were trained on very\\nwell and the knowledge is retained encoded in the model weights as a parameterized knowledgebase.
